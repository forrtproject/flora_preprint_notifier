<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Transsaccadic vision is typically described as the ability to retain and integrate visual information across rapid eye movements (saccades) for the purpose of continuous perception. In this review, we break this down further into two fundamental processes: the cortical mechanisms that maintain extrinsic spatial properties (i.e., location, orientation) versus intrinsic identity cues (i.e., spatial frequency, shape) of objects across saccades.</p><p>First, we summarize the computational problems associated with transsaccadic vision, emphasizing the need to retain and integrate both extrinsic and intrinsic feature information between fixations for predictive vision. Next, we briefly review psychophysical, neurophysiological, stimulation, and neuroimaging evidence that specific cortical mechanisms exist for these processes. Then, we focus on our recent experiments combining functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation-inspired and functional connectivity approaches. These experiments suggest that parietal cortex (specifically, right supramarginal gyrus) contributes to spatial updating of object orientation, whereas dorsomedial occipital cortex (cuneus) supports updating of spatial frequency and object shape. Taken together with the previous literature, this supports the notion that an 'extended parietal eye field' is involved in the updating of extrinsic spatial cues, whereas dorsomedial occipital cortex is involved in updating intrinsic cues to object identity, both in communication with the broader functional networks for perception and action. Finally, we synthesize these results in a simple conceptual model for cortical updating and integration of object features and consider the implications for future studies of transsaccadic integration, the 'binding problem', and possible clinical applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Humans make two to three saccades per second to align the fovea with objects of high interest in the visual field <ref type="bibr" target="#b260">(Wade et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Yarbus, 1967)</ref>. By allowing the brain to focus on foveal information, rather than the entire visual field, this adaptation saves both cortical space and computational costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Herwig, 2015)</ref>. However, it also creates several computational challenges for the brain, with constant visual interruptions and repositioning of the retina relative to the world <ref type="bibr">(Binda &amp; Morrone, 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Hamker et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Ibbotson &amp; Krekelberg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">McFarland et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Melcher &amp; Colby, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Teichert et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">Wurtz, 2008)</ref>. The study of transsaccadic vision is sometimes regarded to be an esoteric topic, i.e., the intersection of the vision and saccade fields, but the reality is that sustained fixation is largely a laboratory phenomenon. Thus, transsaccadic vision is normal vison, so understanding its mechanisms is central to an understanding of vision itself.</p><p>To understand transsaccadic vision, one must first agree on its purpose. Many investigators have stated that the ultimate purpose of transsaccadic vision is to maintain a stable percept despite eye movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Baltaretu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Bridgeman et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Higgins &amp; Rayner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Honda, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Mathôt &amp; Theeuwes, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Melcher &amp; Colby, 2008)</ref>. While this is true from a subjective perspective, from an evolutionary viewpoint the primate visual system developed in a dynamic world full of moving animals and weather phenomena, now expanded to include people and vehicles, so stability in itself cannot be a biological imperative. From a more objective biological viewpoint, the visual system needs to identify what objects are, where they are, and do this rapidly enough to allow us to interact with the world in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Hayhoe, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Hayhoe et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Hayhoe &amp; Ballard, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Hayhoe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Land &amp; Tatler, 2009)</ref>. Done correctly, this ultimately will lead to the subjective perception of stability when our visual surroundings are stable (or not), appropriately reflecting the external reality that surrounds us.</p><p>From this biological viewpoint, the question is, how does the visual system serve its fundamental purpose in the face of constant eye movements? Just over 15 years ago, <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Melcher and Colby (2008)</ref> published a landmark review that outlined several principles of transsaccadic perception based on the knowledge we had at that time. A few years later, our current lab proposed more specific cortical mechanisms based on the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) data available at that time <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">(Prime et al., 2011)</ref>. However, considerable advances have been achieved since then. Here, we update this topic by reviewing the computational challenges associated with transsaccadic vision and the psychophysical, neurophysiological and neuroimaging evidence for specific mechanisms, with a focus on our recent transsaccadic adaptation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baltaretu et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Baltaretu et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Baltaretu et al., , 2023;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Dunkley et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Tomou et al., 2025)</ref>. This evidence leads us to argue that there are separate cortical mechanisms for transsaccadic updating, approximately corresponding to the 'what' and 'where' functions described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Computational Problem(s) of Transsaccadic Vision.</head><p>Transsaccadic vision poses several specific computational problems for the brain. In the following text and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we break these down into four problems and their solutions.</p><p>Visual Smear / Suppression. Saccades cause retinal motion relative to the world, which could result in blurred vision and/or confusion between self-generated and external motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Campbell &amp; Wurtz, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Castet &amp; Masson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Idrees et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Ilg &amp; Hoffmann, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Judge et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Shioiri &amp; Cavanagh, 1989)</ref>. In theory, efference copies (the internal sense of eye motion from the motor system) could cancel this motion to offer continuous visual perception during saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Helmholtz, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Sherrington, 1918;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b236">Sommer &amp; Wurtz, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Subramanian et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Sun &amp; Goldberg, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">von Holst &amp; Mittelstaedt, 1950)</ref>. However, this is biologically limited by the ability of the visual system to process high speeds of motion and generate perfectly calibrated efference copies in space and time <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Castet &amp; Masson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Shioiri &amp; Cavanagh, 1989)</ref>. As a result, perisaccadic vision (vision during saccade execution) is blurred and thus suppressed through both passive and active mechanisms, leaving most people effectively blind during saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Bremmer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Castet &amp; Masson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Diamond et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Higgins &amp; Rayner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Kleiser et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Matin, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">W. Richards, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b227">Schweitzer et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Shioiri &amp; Cavanagh, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b252">Thilo et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">Wurtz, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b276">Zimmermann, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> though, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Idrees et al., 2020)</ref>. This gives rise to a second problem: Visual Interruption / Transsaccadic Memory. Saccades frequently interrupt vision for 30-100 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bahill et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Enderle, 2005)</ref>. Then, an additional ~100-200 ms is required to transmit and process visual information in the cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amano et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Hegdé, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Lamme &amp; Roelfsema, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Matin, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Matin et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Ross et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b271">Wutz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Yoshor et al., 2007)</ref>. If the brain simply discarded all the information from previous fixations (O <ref type="bibr">'Regan &amp; Noë, 2001)</ref>, this would render humans effectively blind half the time -a dangerous situation for any species. Fortunately, it appears that at least some important information is retained (i.e., remembered) and available for predictive processing at the new gaze position <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Blackmore et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Burr et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Kong et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Prime et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Prime et al., , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Prime et al., , 2011;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Tanaka et al., 2014)</ref>, at least until visual information can be processed (see next section for details).</p><p>Space Constancy / Spatial Updating. This leads to a third challenge for transsaccadic vision: because saccades discretely re-orient the retina relative to the world, any new visual information entering the retina will not be in spatial register with the original visual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Crespi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Geng et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Graef et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Jonikaitis &amp; Belopolsky, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Luabeya et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Shafer-Skelton et al., 2017)</ref>. This requires some additional mechanism to spatially update information across fixations <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Deubel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Hamker et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Klier &amp; Angelaki, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Mohsenzadeh et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b266">White &amp; Snyder, 2007)</ref>. In subsequent sections of this review, we will consider several potential mechanisms that have been proposed to solve this problem.</p><p>Binding Problem / Feature Integration. This final computational problem is central to transsaccadic vision, but poorly understood. As noted above, it is not enough to know where things are; it is also necessary to know what they are. More specifically, we need to know the spatial location, orientation and motion of objects, and we need to use objectspecific stimuli to infer the identity of their source. And further, all this information (both stored and new) must be properly integrated across saccades to optimize predictive vision. This is particularly important in tasks that require integration of foveal vision across many saccades, such as scene perception and recognizing large complex objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Blackmore et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Castelhano &amp; Henderson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Choi et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Dowd &amp; Golomb, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Hayhoe et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Hegdé, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Kovacs &amp; Harris, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Oostwoud Wijdenes et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Reuther et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Shafer-Skelton et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b267">Williams &amp; Castelhano, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In the following sections of this review, we will focus mainly on the latter three aspects of transsaccadic vision (memory, updating and integration), specifically, as it relates to the 'where' and 'what' aspects of vision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychophysical Evidence for Transsaccadic Memory and Integration.</head><p>Memory Capacity. In the past, opinions about the capacity of transsaccadic memory have varied wildly from essentially nothing <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Bridgeman et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Bridgeman &amp; Mayer, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bridgeman &amp; Stark, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">O'Regan &amp; Noë, 2001)</ref> to highly detailed information <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Castelhano &amp; Henderson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Henderson &amp; Hollingworth, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Parker &amp; Tas, 2025)</ref>.</p><p>The current consensus is that transsaccadic memory (maintenance of visuospatial information across eye movements) is attention-dependent and has a limited capacity similar to visual working memory, and likely shares many of the same mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Awh et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cronin &amp; Irwin, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Deubel et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hollingworth et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Irwin &amp; Gordon, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Prime et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b241">Stewart &amp; Schütz, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Tanaka et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b250">Theeuwes et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Theeuwes et al., , 2011))</ref>, subject to certain nuances discussed below. In practice, this amounts to 3-4 visual objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Irwin, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Irwin, , 1993;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Irwin &amp; Gordon, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Kong et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Prime et al., 2007)</ref>; although, 'limited resource models' suggesting the mechanism is not discrete <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bays &amp; Husain, 2008)</ref>. Moreover, transsaccadic vision involves the retention and integration of multiple 'what' and 'where' object features. In the following, we expand this notion to two feature categories: extrinsic spatial properties and intrinsic identity cues.</p><p>Extrinsic Spatial Properties. We refer to object location, orientation (of the entire object), and motion as 'extrinsic' spatial properties, because they are generally imposed upon objects by external forces, as opposed to arising from the object. The visual system has the capacity to preserve the spatial properties of at least some task-related objects across saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Hayhoe, Aivar, et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Hayhoe et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Hayhoe, Shrivastava, et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Land et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Land &amp; Hayhoe, 2001)</ref>. This notion dates back to von <ref type="bibr">Helmholtz (1866;</ref><ref type="bibr">trans. Helmholtz, 2013)</ref> and has been confirmed by countless studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bays &amp; Husain, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Binda &amp; Morrone, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Burr &amp; Morrone, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Deubel et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Irwin &amp; Gordon, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Hallett &amp; Lightstone, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Higgins &amp; Rayner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Melcher &amp; Colby, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Prime et al., 2011)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Prime et al. (2006)</ref> showed that participants can compare lines glimpsed from different gaze fixations to compute their intersection point (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>), requiring updating and integration of both line location and orientation.</p><p>How is this done at the computational level, in the brain? It has been shown that some visual information remains linked to its original retinal location after saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afraz &amp; Cavanagh, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chiu &amp; Golomb, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Choi et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Golomb &amp; Kanwisher, 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Harrison &amp; Bex, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Knapen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Mathôt &amp; Theeuwes, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Shafer-Skelton et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">Shafer-Skelton &amp; Golomb, 2018)</ref>, but this does not explain the type of spatial updating and integration described above. One possibility is that this information is transformed, using eye and head position signals, into higher-level egocentric frames fixed to the head or body <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Graef et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Karn et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Yang et al., 2024)</ref>.

To test which brain areas are involved in the updating of intrinsic object features, we employed a similar fMRIa paradigm to that described above, but this time varying a feature linked to object identity, namely spatial frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Baltaretu et al., 2021)</ref>. In this case, we identified an area in dorsomedial occipital cortex (cuneus, corresponding to parts of V1-V3) that showed significant modulations for both, including intrinsic feature modulation (repetition enhancement) and saccade &gt; fixation modulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). We did not find the significant interaction between these two signals that we observed in SMG (see previous section), but their intermingled presence in the same region still points to this region as a putative transsaccadic area. For example, intrinsic visual features and saccade signals could interact either within this site or at the level of its projections (see <ref type="bibr">'Functional Network Analysis' below)</ref>. Comparing this to SMG suggests that 1) extrinsic versus intrinsic updating mechanisms rely on different functional anatomy, and 2) the specific mechanisms (interaction vs. multiplexing) may differ. Multiple Feature Updating. Based on the preceding fMRIa findings, we hypothesized that SMG is involved in spatial updating of object orientation (an extrinsic spatial property), whereas dorsomedial occipital cortex could play a special role in combining saccade and feature information for updating object identity (an intrinsic feature). To test this hypothesis and extend it to the situation where multiple features are updated, we asked participants to remember both extrinsic stimulus orientation and shape (another important intrinsic feature) across saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Baltaretu et al., 2023)</ref>. We found results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>) resembling the sum of our previous single-feature experiments: saccade-specific adaptation in SMG and combined shape / saccade modulations in cuneus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Synthesis. In a dynamic world where perception is disrupted with each saccade, we somehow overcome the imposed challenges in acting and achieving our goals. As reviewed above, this is thought to involve the retention, updating, and integration of visual information across saccades (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Earlier neuroimaging experiments focused on the spatial updating question <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(Medendorp et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Merriam et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Merriam et al., , 2007) )</ref> and TMS experiments suggested that spatial updating also supports transsaccadic memory of object orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(Prime et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">(Prime et al., , 2010))</ref>. However, it was not known whether different cortical mechanisms exist for the retention, updating, and integration of different object features. Given that our surroundings are composed of numerous, complex objects, each with various features, vision scientists have found it useful to make a fundamental distinction between perception of what and where objects are <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Goodale, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Goodale &amp; Milner, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Goodale &amp; Haffenden, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Mishkin et al., 1983)</ref>. Here, we have expanded this to the notion of extrinsic spatial properties (i.e., object location, orientation, motion) and intrinsic cues (e.g., shape, texture, color) to object identity. Specifically, we propose that the brain possesses separate mechanisms for extrinsic vs. intrinsic feature updating, with posterior parietal cortex (specifically, LIP and SMG) playing a special role in the former, and occipital cortex (specifically, the cuneus region) playing an important role in the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Dunkley et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Baltaretu et al. 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baltaretu et al. , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Baltaretu et al. , 2023;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Tomou et al. 2025)</ref>.

Additionally, dlPFC has been shown to guide visual attention, even further back in cortex -in early visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Katsuki &amp; Constantinidis, 2012)</ref>. These connections are potentially able to support extrinsic feature updating through a frontoparietal pathway (via SMG) and intrinsic feature updating through a frontoocipital pathway (via cuneus).</p><p>Limitations and Future Directions. This review and our thesis are clearly subject to several limitations. First, our two-stream theory of transsaccadic cortical processing is based on a limited set of studies examining extrinsic (location, orientation) and intrinsic (spatial frequency, shape) cues. These results need to be replicated and expanded to account for motion processing (which may involve other areas such as MT+) and the various other cues to object identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Crouzet &amp; Serre, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Donderi, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Leeds et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Palmeri &amp; Gauthier, 2004)</ref>. Second, cortical modulations related to attention, which we only mentioned in passing, are also known to play an important role in transsaccadic vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Awh et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Awh &amp; Jonides, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Bichot et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Crapse &amp; Sommer, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Dowd &amp; Golomb, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b276">, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Jonikaitis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b250">Theeuwes et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b275">Zhou &amp; Desimone, 2011)</ref>. Third, we mainly focused on egocentric updating mechanisms, and only touched briefly on the role and mechanisms related to landmark-centered coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bharmauria et al., 2025)</ref>. Fourth, our focus on fMRI results brings the inevitable problem that this technique has poor temporal resolution, whereas perisaccadic signals are transient. And finally, so far, we have made no attempt to relate these signals to specific cellular events.</p><p>One technique that can potentially address some of these limitations is multiunit recordings from various sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">(McFarland et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Seo et al., 2024)</ref>. Our hope is that the framework provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> might inspire such experiments. Further, advances in source localization with human EEG and MEG still lag the spatial resolution of fMRI, but provide virtually unlimited temporal resolution. For example, EEG and MEG have recently been used to test the cortical dynamics of predictive updating <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Fabius et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Kurtzberg &amp; Vaughan, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Parks &amp; Corballis, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Peterburs et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Richards, 2003)</ref>, and graph theory analysis of source-localized EEG signals has been used to track the functional networks of visual and saccade signals through time <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Ghaderi et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The latter included transsaccadic memory of an oriented grating and found functional connectivity between SMG and visual and frontal cortex consistent with our model.</p><p>Finally, a conceptual limitation of the current scheme creates an additional 'binding problem' <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Dowd &amp; Golomb, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b254">Treisman, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Treisman &amp; Sato, 1990</ref>) -the integration of extrinsic and intrinsic signals-but only addresses it at a superficial connectionist level, without providing specific mechanisms. The techniques discussed above (specifically EEG, MEG, and local field potentials from neurophysiology) also provide the opportunity to consider the role of ensemble population oscillations in 'binding' information across saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Chen &amp; Golomb, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chiu &amp; Golomb, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Doucet et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Dowd &amp; Golomb, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Golomb et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Keren et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Kovacs &amp; Harris, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lu &amp; Golomb, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Monosov et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Shafer-Skelton et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Based on our model, we would predict both SMG and cuneus to show synchronized oscillations when updating of both extrinsic and intrinsic features is required.</p><p>Potential Clinical Applications. Any model will ultimately be judged not only by its explanatory power, but also by its application potential. Failures in transsaccadic spatial updating have been implicated in a number of brain disorders, including optic ataxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Cheviet et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Khan et al., 2005)</ref>, thalamic stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Ostendorf et al., 2010)</ref>, right parietal damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">(Pisella, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">Ten Brink et al., 2019)</ref>, frontal cortex damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Duhame et al., 1992)</ref>, and schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bansal et al., 2019)</ref>. While most of these studies have focused on spatial updating of location and fit well with the parietal stream of our conceptual model, the transsaccadic updating of intrinsic features has been less tested.</p><p>Our model would suggest that cuneus damage would give rise to specific deficits in transsaccadic object identification. Toward this end, TMS provides a useful bridge from neuroimaging and neuropsychology results and has already implicated frontal and posterior parietal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Collins &amp; Jacquet, 2018)</ref> in updating object orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">(Prime et al., 2011)</ref>; but, to our knowledge, TMS over cuneus has not been tested during paradigms that involve transsaccadic feature updating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Saccades are both necessary and problematic for vision. However, these problems are mostly overcome through the mechanisms of transsaccadic vision -an associated set of processes for perception, oculomotor execution, attention, working memory, and executive control. Here, we make a case for distinguishing between transsaccadic vision for two distinct feature categories: extrinsic spatial cues vs. intrinsic cues to object identity.</p><p>After reviewing the general state of knowledge on the cortical mechanisms for transsaccadic vision we further propose two separate cortical mechanisms: a parietal mechanism for extrinsic spatial feature updating, and an occipital mechanism for updating intrinsic identity cues, along with their functional circuitry. We suggest that future work should focus on understanding how these object properties are bound together, identify the complete functional networks that support this, and provide possible reinterpretations and avenues for clinical application. Given that saccades are inextricable from real-world visual behavior, solving these questions is tantamount to understanding vision itself.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
