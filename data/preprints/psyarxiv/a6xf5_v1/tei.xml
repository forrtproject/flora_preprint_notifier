<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Voting is a critical component of representative democracy but yields consistently low engagement from young Americans. Online communication interventions have the potential to catalyze action, but evidence regarding best practices for digital, youth-focused get-out-the-vote (GOTV) messaging is sparse. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and Reasoned Action approaches, we integrated formative and participatory research approaches to fill this gap. In a partnership between communication researchers and a college student-led GOTV organization, we conducted formative research integrating experiential knowledge from youth partners with scientific evidence to generate a set of voting beliefs. We used the standard Hornik &amp; Woolf method to select promising beliefs to target in messaging but also conducted post-hoc analyses demonstrating the potential of network approaches that take into account relationships among beliefs to identify influential beliefs. We then co-designed belief-informed GOTV messages that could be disseminated via social media and tested message effects in both local and national samples of college students. We found that the messages co-designed with youth to target promising voting beliefs were more motivating, persuasive, and self-relevant than existing GOTV social media messages from a national youth-focused campaign. They were also more motivating and persuasive than prior messages from our student-led GOTV partner organization-which were not designed using formative research-suggesting that the combination of formative and participatory research practices increases message effectiveness. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of engaging youth in voting research and illustrate the benefits of integrating theory-based formative research, network approaches, and human-centered participatory practices to develop messaging campaigns.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In the U.S. and other representative democracies, voting is a crucial mechanism that enables citizens to express opinions and influence political outcomes. However, approximately one in five eligible voters in the United States is not registered to vote <ref type="bibr">(Pew, 2022)</ref>. Out of all age groups, youth and young adults aged 18-29 also tend to have the lowest turnout <ref type="bibr">(Pew, 2023a)</ref>. Despite lower voting turnout, they are not apathetic <ref type="bibr">(CIRCLE, 2025a)</ref>. Youth express high levels of concern about political issues <ref type="bibr">(Pew, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Martin, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pew, 2023b)</ref>, have a degree of interest in political issues comparable to older generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Holbein and Hillygus 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021)</ref>, and engage in other political behaviors such as boycotting/buycotting, signing petitions, or attending protests and demonstrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Zukin et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">CIRCLE, 2023a)</ref>. This highlights the potential to leverage communication interventions to convert political interest into motivation to vote. Indeed, numerous nonprofit organizations, such as Rock the Vote and NextGen America , are focused solely on registering and turning out youth to vote. Given their digital nativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Teo, 2013)</ref>, messaging strategies can reach youth through social media and other online resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Delli Carpini, 2000)</ref>. However, scientific evidence is sparse regarding what communication interventions are most effective for youth, particularly on social media. We address this gap using a fully collaborative, participatory action research approach in partnership with youth to design theory-based, youth-focused GOTV messages that can be disseminated on social media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Youth voting</head><p>Youth and young adults aged 18-29 consistently have lower voting turnout than older adults <ref type="bibr">(Pew, 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021)</ref>. A commonly cited barrier for youth is a sense of having insufficient knowledge or information about the registration and voting process or candidates and issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Knoester &amp; Kretz, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Knoester &amp; Gichiru, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kawashima-Ginsburg and Kiesa, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">CIRCLE, 2023a)</ref>. However, psychological and social factors such as self-efficacy, political efficacy, civic duty, social norms, or affiliation with a social movement also affect motivation to vote in youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Knoester &amp; Kretz, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kawashima-Ginsburg &amp; Kiesa, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">CIRCLE, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Apau et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Levy &amp; Akiva, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Condon &amp; Holleque, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Glynn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lydic et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Prior research has explored a variety of strategies to increase youth voting, including informational and civic education interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Feldman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McDevitt &amp; Chaffee, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Syvertsen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bennion and Nickerson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Haenschen &amp; and Jennings, 2019)</ref>, events that aim to foster political socialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Howard &amp; Posler, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bennion &amp; Michelson, 2023)</ref>, and voting pledge campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Costa et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burgess et al., 2000)</ref>. Many of these interventions have been implemented on college campuses, where there is a unique proximity to youth and resources to organize GOTV activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bennion &amp; Michelson, 2023)</ref>. However, these campus-based campaigns can be difficult to scale, and there has been relatively less research on mass communication interventions to increase youth turnout.</p><p>GOTV communication research has demonstrated that media efforts can support youth voting, but the effects are often small and findings are inconsistent across studies. Impersonal, mass media messages have particularly inconsistent effects. For example, Rock the Vote television ads, which target young voters, have been considered both effective and cost-competitive methods for increasing youth turnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Green &amp; Vavreck, 2006)</ref>. On the other hand, Rock the Vote spent more money on these ads with less impact than other campaigns at the time, and did not address the most frequent barriers reported by youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Richards, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Orr &amp; Hoover, 2007)</ref>. Prior work has also shown mixed results about the role of subtle linguistic cues in GOTV messaging. For example, in majority young-adult samples, - <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bryan et al. (2011)</ref> found that "invoking the self" by framing voting questions around a sense of identity ("being a voter") was more effective than framing questions around the behavior itself ("voting"), though this intervention was less effective in other studies including older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gerber et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Beyond mixed evidence regarding which message frames are most effective, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Nickerson (2006)</ref> found that GOTV efforts can be as effective for youth (18-24) as older adults, but that youth are harder to contact via phone or door-to-door canvassing. Indeed, youth are contacted less frequently than older adults before elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(CIRCLE, 2022)</ref>. Thus, strategies that adopt youths' preferred communication systems could yield greater reach, highlighting the necessity for more research on messaging campaign design, delivery, and impact in online spaces. Employing social media as a dissemination tool for GOTV messaging campaigns, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Teresi &amp; Michelson (2015)</ref> found that GOTV messages delivered through online social networks can increase turnout in college students. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Unan et al. (2024)</ref> found null effects of social media messaging campaigns on young voter (aged 18-35) registration across three studies in the U.K. Prior work has thus yielded inconclusive evidence for best practices in GOTV social media communication efforts. Additionally, researchers and practitioners alike could better engage youth in the development of messaging campaigns. Prior qualitative evaluation of youth-led GOTV efforts highlights their potential for success <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jameson-Charles &amp; Charles, 2022)</ref>, but quantitative evidence is lacking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GOTV campaign development</head><p>Borrowing from theories of health messaging campaign development <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010)</ref>, we argue that GOTV communication strategies may be more effective if campaigns address the beliefs about voting that are most malleable and most likely to lead to action if successfully targeted by persuasive messaging. That is, real-world GOTV messaging can benefit from integrating theories of behavior change, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, which centers behavioral, normative, and control beliefs as targets for behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory of Planned Behavior</head><p>The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) proposes that intentions and behavior are shaped by upstream beliefs about the behavior (behavioral beliefs), how normative it is (normative beliefs), and one's ability to engage in the behavior (control beliefs). Prior research has identified numerous classes of beliefs that are associated with voting intentions and behavior. With respect to behavioral beliefs, individuals are more likely to vote if they view voting as their personal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bali et al., 2020)</ref>, civic <ref type="bibr">(Lydic et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Harder &amp; Krosnick, 2008)</ref>, or moral duty <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Blais &amp; Daoust, 2020)</ref>; see voting as important to them personally <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Knoester &amp; Kretz, 2017)</ref>; have high political interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Levy &amp; Akiva, 2019)</ref>; expect the outcome of the election to benefit themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bali et al., 2020)</ref>; and anticipate experiencing positive or negative emotions as a result of the election <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Knight &amp; Peterson, 2022)</ref>. Having high trust in government or faith in the political system <ref type="bibr">(CIRCLE, 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kawashima-Ginsburg &amp; Kiesa, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Apau et al., 2025)</ref> and believing that it is responsive to the public (i.e., external political efficacy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Harder &amp; Krosnick, 2008)</ref> are also positively associated with voting. Normative beliefs that voting can promote solidarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Harder &amp; Krosnick, 2008)</ref> and belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bali et al., 2020)</ref>, and is engaged in by in-group members <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Glynn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021)</ref> are also positively associated with voting. Control beliefs related to political efficacy and self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Condon &amp; Holleque, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Harder &amp; Krosnick, 2008)</ref>, having civic knowledge and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Maiello et al., 2003)</ref>, ease of registration and voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Harder &amp; Krosnick, 2008)</ref>, and knowledge about candidates and ballot measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Knoester &amp; Kretz, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Knoester &amp; Gichiru, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kawashima-Ginsburg and Kiesa, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">CIRCLE, 2022)</ref> are also associated with whether individuals vote. Although prior work has shown that many of these beliefs are relevant in youth voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Knight &amp; Peterson, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lydic et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kawashima-Ginsburg &amp; Kiesa, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Apau et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Glynn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Condon &amp; Holleque, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Knoester &amp; Kretz, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Knoester &amp; Gichiru, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">CIRCLE, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Levy &amp; Akiva, 2019)</ref>, there has not been a systematic examination of these beliefs among college students to determine which beliefs might be most effectively targeted in messaging campaigns. Prior work has applied TPB to voting intentions and behavior in young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Glasford, 2008)</ref>, but this study did not examine specific beliefs about voting. Moreover, extant research on voting beliefs does consider the relative strengths of associations between beliefs and voting intentions and behavior.</p><p>To identify voting beliefs among youth that can be targeted in messaging campaigns with the greatest potential impact, preliminary (formative) research on a broad range of specific behavioral beliefs is needed. Formative research is a preliminary research procedure to gather insights from the target population in order to inform messaging campaign or intervention design and tailoring <ref type="bibr">(Capella, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Martinez et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Pleasant et al., 2020)</ref>. Formative research practices solicit voices from the target population to direct intervention design towards changing particular beliefs that show the strongest relationships with the target behavior. Conducting formative research increases the success of interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Pleasant et al., 2020)</ref> and provides opportunities for the target population to inform the problem definition and offer nuanced perspectives on what motivates (or demotivates) their behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identifying promising beliefs through formative research</head><p>There is robust evidence from public health campaign research that designing messages to target promising beliefs, identified through formative research, is an effective way to shift behavioral intentions <ref type="bibr">(Hornik and Woolfe, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Hornik et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fishbein and Cappella, 2006)</ref>. Reasoned Action models of behavior change, such as TPB, posit that behavior stems from a network of beliefs that shape attitudes about the behavior, which in turn influence intentions and subsequent behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Fishbein and Ajzen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>. Promising beliefs are those that are strongly associated with intentions to engage in a target behavior-in this case, voting-and can distinguish between people who do and do not intend to engage in the behavior. Crucially, promising beliefs should not already be widely held by the target population so that interventions have room to move beliefs (i.e., avoiding ceiling effects). By targeting promising beliefs, messaging interventions can increase belief strength, which in turn can increase intentions and behavior <ref type="bibr">(Hornik and Woolfe, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Hornik et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fishbein and Cappella, 2006)</ref>. Although this approach is widely used in the field of health communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Pleasant et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Hornik et al., 2018)</ref>, it has not yet been adopted to design GOTV messages. Although promising beliefs have been shown to be more strongly predictive of future behavior change than other beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Hornik et al., 2018)</ref>, messages targeting less promising beliefs can still induce positive effects if they are correlated with more promising beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lee et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, it is also important to consider the relationships among beliefs when designing campaigns.</p><p>Recent research in political psychology and communication has applied network approaches to study relationships among beliefs <ref type="bibr">(Brant &amp; Sleegers, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vlasceanu et al., 2024)</ref>. Psychological network approaches to understanding belief systems conceptualize beliefs as nodes in a network and the relationships between beliefs as edges connecting nodes. By constructing belief networks in this way, graph theory methods can be applied to understand network properties, how they differ among individuals and groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brandt, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brandt &amp; Sleegers;</ref><ref type="bibr">2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vlasceanu et al., 2024)</ref>, and how messaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Keating, 2024)</ref> and other interventions can shift attitudes and behavior by targeting beliefs to induce changes in the network <ref type="bibr">(Brant &amp; Sleegers, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turner-Zwinkels &amp; Brant, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Vlasceanu et al., 2023)</ref>. Examining the interrelationships among beliefs using network methods also has the potential to help researchers to identify beliefs with relatively stronger influence on the network that would make them promising intervention targets. As such, measures of network centrality-which index the relative importance and influence of nodes within a network based on their location and connections-may represent a complementary approach to identifying promising beliefs in formative research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Youth participatory action research</head><p>Whereas traditional methods of formative research typically have limited engagement with the target population, participatory action research engages communities in deeper ways. Youth participatory action research (YPAR) is a research framework that engages youth in the process of problem identification; research design, implementation, and interpretation; and taking action to address the identified problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ozer et al., 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">, Ozer &amp; Piatt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Cornish et al., 2023)</ref>. Beyond the aim of producing knowledge through research, a primary goal of YPAR is to empower youth to identify and interrogate issues they are affected by, and develop and enact solutions to address them <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ozer et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Ozer &amp; Piatt, 2018)</ref>. A guiding principle of YPAR is that youth are experts on their own experiences and can contribute meaningfully to the research process, and researchers can support youth to develop civic and research skills in the process <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cornish et al., 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">, Ozer et al., 2024)</ref>. As a co-design process, YPAR provides a deeper opportunity to uplift youth voices in communication intervention and campaign development, where youth can offer their own expertise about what motivates and hinders them.</p><p>Though YPAR has been implemented to address a broad array of youth-relevant issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anyon et al., 2018)</ref>, it has only recently begun to be applied in communication research. Recent research in health communication has demonstrated that formative research, message design, and message testing can be carried out with and benefit from a YPAR approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kikut-Stein et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kikut-Stein et al., 2025)</ref>. In the present studies, we expand the YPAR-communication framework laid out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kikut-Stein et al. (2024</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2025)</ref> to the domain of voting research, across all stages of campaign design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The current studies</head><p>Prior evidence underscores the need for effective, evidence-based messaging strategies to motivate youth voting. We address this gap using a participatory approach that involved youth in all stages of a research process to create youth-focused GOTV messages to motivate voting on our local college campus during the 2024 general election. The study team included members of a communication research lab as well as members of a student-led, nonpartisan GOTV organization on campus, Penn Leads the Vote (PLTV). Across three studies, we conducted formative research to map voting beliefs among youth (18-25 year olds) and identify promising beliefs (Study 1). In addition to using the standard <ref type="bibr">Hornik &amp; Woolf method (1999)</ref> to select promising beliefs, we also applied a novel network approach that considers relationships among beliefs to identify influential beliefs. We then co-designed GOTV messages targeting these promising beliefs (Study 2) and evaluated how effective the co-designed messages were compared to existing GOTV messages from local and national campaigns (Study 3). This work represents a novel integration of theory-driven formative research and participatory practices to design GOTV messages for youth, with youth. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Formative research on voting beliefs</head><p>In this study, we conducted survey research to identify promising beliefs about voting among college students that could be targeted in social media messages in subsequent studies. Although we used the Hornik &amp; Woolf method to select promising beliefs during the 2024 election season, we also conducted post-hoc network analyses to examine the relationships among beliefs and explore centrality as a complementary method for promising belief identification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited through listservs of undergraduate majors ( n = 136) and through the Human Subjects Pool at the University of Pennsylvania ( n = 184) in late August and early September 2024. Inclusion criteria were as follows: current Penn students, aged 18+ years, fluent in English, and eligible to vote in the November 2024 U.S. general election. Given that youth were our target audience, participants who were older than 25 were ultimately excluded from analysis ( n = 46). This resulted in a total of 274 participants who were aged 18-25 ( M = 20.1, SD = 1.4). Participants self-reported the following gender identities: 23.4% men, 74.1% women, 0.4% genderqueer, 0.4% non-binary, 1.5% preferred not to say, and 0.4% preferred to self-describe. With respect to race and ethnicity, participants identified as the following: 46.4% White, 22.4% East Asian, 10.2% Black or African American, 5.8% South Asian, 7.8% Southeast Asian, 2.0% Middle Eastern or North African, 0.3% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 0.7% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 1.4% other racial/ethnic identity not listed. 8.3% of participants also identified as Hispanic or Latina/o/x. This study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board and participants gave informed consent. Participants were compensated for participation via a $5 Amazon gift card or course credit for completing a 15-minute survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Belief identification</head><p>We generated a set of initial beliefs by identifying factors that may motivate people to vote, values and beliefs related to voting, and barriers that may make it difficult to vote. During this generation phase, we drew from the existing literature on voting behavior reviewed above, prior studies conducted by our team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Lydic et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cosme et al., 2023)</ref>, our personal experiences, and youth team members' conversations with peers about voting. In total, we generated 37 beliefs that we expected may be positively or negatively related to voting intentions. Example beliefs and associated themes are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and all beliefs are listed in Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>.</p><p>Table 1 Example beliefs tested in the formative research survey in Study 1 Theme Text Valence Self-efficacy It's too difficult or effortful to find out how to register to vote Negative Belonging Voting makes me feel like I'm part of a community Positive Self-relevance Voting is consistent with my core values Positive Instrumentality Voting can contribute to building a better world Positive Response efficacy Even if I vote, nothing will change for people like me Negative Personal impact</p><p>The outcome of the election will affect my rights and freedoms Neutral Social impact</p><p>There is a lot at stake for people I care about in the election Neutral</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Eligible participants completed an online survey administered via Qualtrics. After consenting, participants were presented with 37 belief statements (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). For each statement, participants used a 7-point Likert-type scale to indicate their agreement, ranging from 1 = "Strongly Disagree" to 7 = "Strongly Agree," capturing participants' endorsement of each belief. Participants then completed a series of questionnaires designed to evaluate their attitudes, intentions, behaviors, and motivations regarding voting and civic engagement. Participants responded to 10 items based on the Theory of Planned Behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref> to assess intention to vote ("I plan to vote in the 2024 general election"; 1 = "Definitely not" to 7 = "Definitely yes") as well as intentions to register and make a plan, attitudes, norms, perceived behavioral control, and past voting behaviors. Correlations between beliefs and these additional measures are included in Supplementary Material (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S4</ref>). Participants also completed additional measures of motivation, civic engagement, and civic attitudes that are not the focus of the present study. After completing these measures, participants responded to demographic questions and were provided with an opportunity to give feedback through an open-response question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Promising beliefs</head><p>We used the <ref type="bibr">Hornik &amp; Woolf method (1999)</ref> to identify promising beliefs. We dichotomized the continuous measures of intentions to vote by categorizing people who selected "strongly agree" as "intenders" and people who selected any other option as "non-intenders." We followed a similar approach with the belief strength variables; beliefs for which participants selected "strongly (dis)agree" were recoded as "strong" beliefs, whereas beliefs for which any other values were selected were recoded as "weak" beliefs. Using these cross-tabs, we calculated the percentage to gain for each belief. Percentage to gain was calculated by subtracting the total percentage of people who intend to vote from the percentage of people who intend to vote and strongly endorse the belief. An example of this calculation is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> (97.8% -70.3% = 27.5% to gain). In addition to calculating the percentage to gain for each belief, we calculated the mean difference in continuous (i.e., non-dichotomized) belief strength for intenders and non-intenders, the correlation between continuous belief strength and intentions to vote, and the percentage to move , which reflects the number of people who do not strongly hold a belief. Higher values indicate greater potential for messaging campaigns to shift beliefs. 97.8%) a 192 (70.3%) b Total 181 (100.0%) 92 (100.0%) 273 (100.0%) Note . Percentage to gain is calculated per belief by subtracting the percentage of the sample that are intenders (denoted as b ) from the percentage of the sample that are intenders and hold a given belief strongly (denoted as a ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Belief network</head><p>In post-hoc analyses, we explored the structure of the relationships among beliefs using a network approach. Specifically, we estimated a Gaussian Graphical Model-an undirected network of partial correlations-using the graphical LASSO (GLASSO) regularization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Friedman et al., 2008)</ref> to obtain a sparse network implemented in the qgraph package <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Epskamp et al., 2012)</ref>. We chose this method because simulation studies indicate that this method can recover the true underlying network structures with high sensitivity <ref type="bibr">(Fried &amp; Eskamp, 2018)</ref> and has been used in previous studies examining belief networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Turner-Zwinkels et al., 2022)</ref>. We also explored how beliefs clustered together using community detection methods. We applied an agglomerative walktrap algorithm from the igraph package <ref type="bibr">(Csárdi, 2021)</ref> to identify densely connected communities using random walks <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Pons &amp; Latapy, 2005)</ref>. We selected this algorithm given its ability to accurately recover network communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hoffman et al., 2017)</ref> and its use in studying belief networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Quintana, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Turner-Zwinkels et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">2022)</ref>.</p><p>From this network, we calculated the eigenvector centrality for each belief node as a measure of centrality. To validate centrality as a metric to compare and identify promising beliefs, we examined the correlation between node centrality and the average correlation between the belief and voting intention. We focused on eigenvector centrality as a measure of centrality because it reflects not only the number of connections but how influential connections are, reflecting greater potential impact if targeted. Furthermore, while researchers should use caution when inferring causal importance from centrality measures, eigenvector centrality predicts the actual causal influence of nodes reasonably well <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dablander &amp; Hinne, 2019)</ref>. Correlational values were Fisher z-transformed and the absolute value was used since eigenvector centrality does not take into account the sign of relationships.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations with voting intentions</head><p>All beliefs showed statistically significant correlations with intention to vote and statistically significant mean differences between intenders and non-intenders. Negative correlations ranged from r = -.71 ("Voting is not important to me") to r = -.26 ("Not voting is a form of self-expression") and positive correlations ranged from r = .35 ("Voting makes me feel connected to others") to r = .58 ("Voting is relevant to me personally"). Correlations for promising beliefs with &gt;20% to gain (see below) are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>; correlations for all beliefs are reported in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Percentage to move</head><p>The most common strongly held beliefs (i.e., beliefs participants strongly agreed or strongly disagreed with) were "voting is my right" (percentage to move = 28.5) and "the outcome of the election will impact the future of our country" (percentage to move = 43.8). All other beliefs were strongly held by less than half of the sample (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>), indicating substantial room to move.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Percentage to gain</head><p>Percentage to gain ranged from 11.2%-28.5%, and 29 beliefs had percentage to gain values &gt;20%, which we used as a threshold to identify "promising beliefs" to target in messaging. Four of the top five most promising beliefs were related behavioral beliefs related to the self ("Voting is consistent with my core values", "Voting is not important to me") and disillusionment ("It doesn't matter if I personally vote", "The system is too broken to be fixed by voting"). Percentage to gain values and descriptive statistics for the promising beliefs are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and for the remaining beliefs in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Belief network</head><p>Network structure. Applying a community detection algorithm revealed a moderately modular structure (modularity = 0.47) with five clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>) roughly corresponding to: (1) control beliefs (e.g., "It's too difficult to find out how to register to vote"), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) normative beliefs about belonging (e.g., "Voting makes me feel like I'm part of a community"), (3) behavioral beliefs about the instrumentality of voting (e.g., "Voting is a way I can express my voice about issues I care about", "Voting is a way to contribute to building a better world"), (4) behavioral beliefs about the impact of the election and relevance of voting (e.g., "Voting impacts policies and outcomes I care about", "Voting affects the rights and freedoms of people I care about"), and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) negative behavioral beliefs (e.g., "If I don't like the candidates, it's not worth voting") and beliefs related to the importance of voting (e.g., "It doesn't matter if I personally vote", "Voting is consistent with my core values").</p><p>Descriptively examining the beliefs within each cluster revealed several interesting insights. First, the clusters containing control beliefs and normative beliefs about belonging each contained beliefs of a single type, whereas the other clusters contained a combination of normative and behavioral beliefs. Second, the latter clusters contained a mix of self-related (e.g., "There is a lot at stake for me personally") and social behavioral beliefs (e.g., "There is a lot at stake for people I care about"). Third, self-related and social beliefs within these clusters were not segregated but were instead often tightly linked (e.g., "Voting will affect my rights and freedoms" and "Voting will impact my local community"). Fourth, although normative beliefs tended to be more strongly associated with other normative or social beliefs within these clusters, there were some surprisingly strong connections with self-related behavioral beliefs (e.g., "Voting is my duty" and "Voting is consistent with my core values").</p><p>We quantified the number of connections between communities to examine their interrelationships and found substantial variability. Clusters 4 (behavioral beliefs about impact) and 5 (negative beliefs and beliefs about importance) had the most connections (n = 15), whereas clusters 4 and 2 (belonging beliefs), clusters 4 and 1 (control beliefs), and clusters 1 and 2 had no connections. Cluster 5 had connections to all other clusters (n cluster 1 = 9, n cluster 2 = 1, n cluster 3 = 10), and Cluster 3 (instrumental beliefs) was moderately connected to other all clusters (n cluster 1 = 5, n cluster 2 = 5, n cluster 4 = 7).</p><p>Belief centrality. Averaging across beliefs in each cluster, behavioral beliefs about the impact of the election and relevance of voting tended to be most central ( M = 0.83; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). Overall, "Voting is relevant to me personally" was the most central belief and numerous other beliefs associated with self-relevance (e.g., voting affecting one's rights and freedoms, voting being consistent with one's core values, voting not being personally important, etc.) also tended to be more central. Behavioral beliefs about the instrumentality of voting ( M = 0.68), normative beliefs about belonging ( M = 0.65) and behavioral beliefs about the importance of voting ( M = 0.58), were less central, and control beliefs ( M = 0.44) were the least central. In addition to control beliefs, negative behavioral beliefs related to disillusionment (e.g., "Not voting is a form of self-expression", "The system is too broken to be fixed by voting") tended to be the least central.</p><p>Association between belief centrality and correlation with intention to vote. Examining the relationship between belief node centrality and the mean absolute correlation between beliefs and voting intentions revealed a strong correlation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). Beliefs that were more central also tended to be more strongly correlated with intentions to vote ( r (35) = .62, 95% CI [.37, .79], t = 4.70, p &lt; .001).</p><p>Associations between belief centrality and percentage to move and to gain. In contrast to the correlations with intentions to vote, belief centrality was weakly negatively associated with percentage to move ( r (35) = -.20, 95% CI [-.49, .13], t = 1.20, p = .238) but the relationship was not statistically significant. The correlation between belief centrality and percentage to gain was near zero ( r (35) = .03, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.30, .35</ref>], t = 0.17, p = .867). Although centrality and percentage to gain were not correlated, we examined areas of correspondence between these two methods by identifying beliefs that were above average for both centrality and percentage to gain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>).</p><p>Table 4 Beliefs with above average centrality and percentage to gain Cluster Belief text Perspective (2) Belonging Voting makes me feel like I'm part of a community Social (3) Instrumentality Voting is a way I can advance the causes I care about Self-related Voting is a way I can speak up for others Social Voting allows me to be a part of something bigger than myself Social (4) Impact</p><p>Voting is relevant to me personally Self-related There is a lot at stake for me personally in the election Self-related There is a lot at stake for people I care about in the election Social The outcome of the election will impact my local community Social (5) Importance/negative</p><p>Voting is consistent with my core values Self-related It doesn't matter if I personally vote Self-related Voting is not important to me Self-related Voting is my duty Social between belief node centrality and mean absolute correlation between belief strength and voting intention.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Study 1 surveyed college students to identify promising beliefs about voting to target via social media messaging. Voting beliefs ranged from being moderately to highly correlated with voting intentions and the majority of beliefs were not strongly held, indicating substantial potential to strengthen voting beliefs in this population. We used the Hornik &amp; Woolf method to calculate the percentage to gain-that is, the possible increase in people who intend to vote (i.e., endorse "strongly agree") that could be achieved if everyone strongly held the belief. We identified 29 beliefs that had more than 20% to gain. These beliefs were from across belief categories, highlighting that there are numerous pathways to target voting beliefs through messaging.</p><p>Although the percentage to gain was the metric we used to inform message development in this project-that is, in the subsequent studies in this paper-we also conducted post-hoc analyses examining the structure of the voting belief network to inform future message development. We found that belief centrality and correlation with intentions were robustly related; beliefs with higher eigenvector centrality also tended to have higher average correlations with voting intentions. Given the strength of the correlation, considering belief centrality could provide a complementary method to determine which beliefs to target in messaging campaigns.</p><p>In this sample, behavioral beliefs about the personal importance of voting and the self-related and social consequences of the election tended to be most central, whereas control beliefs and negative behavioral beliefs related to disillusionment tended to be the least central. This suggests that messages that help people identify why voting is relevant to themselves and how the outcome of the election will impact themselves and their communities have greater potential to increase voting intentions because the underlying beliefs can activate other influential beliefs, strengthening the overall effect.</p><p>Although belief centrality was strongly associated with belief-voting intention correlations, it was not associated with percentage to gain. The percentage to gain metric combines information about strength of the relationship with intention (i.e., its correlation) but also how commonly held the belief is (i.e., the percentage to move). How central beliefs are was strongly related to the correlation with intention to vote but only weakly related to percentage to move, and this relationship was negative. This suggests that beliefs that are more central may also be somewhat more common. This underscores the usefulness of the Hornik &amp; Woolf method, yet also suggests that formative research can gain unique insights from incorporating network approaches in tandem to identify influential beliefs that still have room to move.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Message co-design and testing</head><p>The goal of this study was to develop nonpartisan, youth-focused GOTV messages targeting promising voting beliefs identified in Study 1 using the Hornik and Woolf method. In order to create messages that would be effective for college students, we used a participatory co-design process to develop the messages with undergraduate researchers on our team. Participatory approaches acknowledge lived experience as a form of expertise and seek to center it in research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cornish et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Ozer et al., 2024)</ref>.

In the Message development sample, we recruited a national sample of college students via the Prolific platform to quickly test a large set of initial messages. Based on this initial testing, we then refined the messages and tested a subset of the messages in a sample from our target population-college students at the University of Pennsylvania (Message testing sample). In both samples, participants viewed messages and rated perceived argument strength, nonpartisanship, and the correspondence between each message and targeted beliefs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Written message co-creation</head><p>We iteratively and collaboratively developed messages targeting promising beliefs identified in Study 1. Research team members each chose 2-4 promising beliefs and brainstormed two messages for each belief. Ideas were not limited to text-based messages but also included visual arguments (e.g., short comics or single-panel illustrations). In line with Hornik &amp; Woolf method, we only targeted beliefs that we determined could plausibly be changed by messaging campaigns. Targeted beliefs are highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>. We then refined the messages through an iterative process of review and revision.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual message co-creation</head><p>We adapted the message text to create visuals for use on social media. A research team member with expertise in visual design developed images using Canva, an online design tool. The key features that were considered during adaptation included the target audience (young adults), demographic diversity (e.g., with respect to race, ethnicity, and gender), visual accessibility (e.g., colors with enough contrast to be seen clearly by most viewers), appropriate visual themes (images that symbolize voting, civic engagement, etc.). Images were then iteratively refined in response to feedback from the research team. The initial stimulus set used in the Message development sample contained 29 messages. After initial testing, three additional messages that combined informational and persuasive elements from other messages were developed for testing in the Message testing sample.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Message development sample</head><p>At the beginning of the online survey, participants provided informed consent and were then shown 12 messages. Messages were separated into four thematic groups for presentation in the survey-self, social, duty and response efficacy, and informational-and participants saw a random sample of 3 messages from each group. For each message, participants rated perceived argument strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Zhao et al., 2011)</ref>, nonpartisanship, and message alignment with the beliefs it was designed to target. Perceived argument strength was assessed with nine items using a 5-point Likert-type agreement scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree) or a 5-point Likert-type strength scale (1 = Very weak, 5 = Very strong) for statement strength. Nonpartisanship was measured using a single item ("This statement is nonpartisan"; 1 = Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree). Belief alignment was measured by asking participants to rate their agreement that "This message makes me believe…" for a set of beliefs using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree). Beliefs were grouped such that only beliefs related to the message thematic group were presented for each message. Each category included 3-5 beliefs; examples include: "There is a lot at stake for me personally in the election" ( self group); "Voting allows me to be a part of something bigger than myself" ( social group); "The system is too broken to be fixed by voting" ( duty and response efficacy group); "It's too difficult or effortful to make a plan to vote" ( informational group). After rating the messages, participants reported demographics and completed individual difference measures not discussed in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Message testing sample</head><p>A similar procedure was used to test a set of 14 messages, which were selected and refined based on the results from the Message development sample. Twelve messages from the Message development sample were selected based on the message effectiveness criteria outlined in the following paragraph. Three new messages were created that blended information about how to vote from the informational messages with persuasive content from social messages that were not selected. However, due to a technical error, one of these new messages was not presented, resulting in a total of 14 messages. For randomization purposes, these messages were separated into two groups in the survey-one that combined self and duty messages, and one that combined social and response efficacy messages. Participants were presented with a random sample of five messages from each group for a total of 10 messages. For each message, they followed the same rating procedure as in Study 2a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining message effectiveness</head><p>We evaluated the effectiveness of the messages by considering ratings of nonpartisanship, argument strength and belief strength. First, we excluded messages rated as somewhat partisan (i.e., the average nonpartisan rating was below the midpoint of the scale disagreeing that the message was nonpartisan; n = 1 in the Message development sample). Then, we created a composite score integrating argument and target belief strength. Because we sought to identify messages that induced targeted beliefs and made strong, persuasive arguments about voting, we used a multiplicative approach (i.e., multiplying argument and belief strength) requiring both dimensions to be high to achieve a high score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations between promising belief metrics and message effectiveness</head><p>Building on the results from Study 1 showing that percentage to gain and belief centrality might both be used to guide message development, we conducted post-hoc analyses examining relationships between these metrics for the beliefs targeted in each message and message effectiveness. We combined data from the Message development and testing samples and averaged centrality and percentage to gain across all beliefs targeted in each message to get a single value for each, per message. We then fit linear mixed effects models regressing message effectiveness on all potential models including the fixed effects of centrality and percentage to gain and used model comparison to select best fitting models. Results for the composite score are reported in the main manuscript and results for argument and belief strength are reported in Supplementary Material along with detailed methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Message development sample</head><p>The goal of this analysis was to select a set of 15 messages that could be used in subsequent message testing in our target audience-college students at the University of Pennsylvania (Message testing sample). Messages were ranked by message effectiveness score to guide selection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Overall, self-related messages targeting behavioral beliefs about the impact, importance, and instrumentality of voting tended to be the most effective (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Notably, informational messages targeting control beliefs were the least effective. Because these messages did not include persuasive arguments, we generated three new messages that combined information about how to vote with persuasive elements from social messages targeting normative beliefs about belonging for testing in the Message testing sample. To create a set of 15 messages, we selected the 12 messages with the highest message effectiveness scores, which included self-related ( n = 7), social ( n = 2), response efficacy ( n = 2), and duty ( n = 1) messages. Mean nonpartisan ratings, argument strength ratings, belief strength ratings, and composite scores for individual messages are reported in Supplementary Material (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Message testing sample</head><p>Descriptives All messages (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>) were rated as nonpartisan (M range = 3.46 -4.17). Descriptively, self-related messages targeting behavioral beliefs about the impact of the election (e.g., self_2: "The outcome of the election will impact these issues for better or worse… vote to have a say in what happens.") made the strongest arguments ( M = 3.83, SD = 0.73 ) , followed by messages targeting: behavioral beliefs about the importance of voting (e.g., efficacy_6: "Myth: Voting doesn't matter if I'm not in a swing state. Fact: 33 states have Senate seats open and every state has Representative seats open -the ballot is more than a presidential election!") and negative beliefs (e.g., efficacy_3: "If your vote doesn't matter, no one's does. Every vote counts!"; M = 3.67, SD = 0.80), behavioral beliefs about the instrumentality of voting (e.g., self_1: "Do you care about ___? Voting is a way to express concerns on an issue together."; M = 3.43, SD = 0.81), and the combined messages targeting control and belonging beliefs (e.g., "Voting is confusing! It's easier to make sense of it together. Share this step-by-step guide with people you care about! usa.gov/how-to-vote"; M = 3.24, SD = 0.85). A similar order was observed for belief strength: impact beliefs ( M = 5.42, SD = 1.37), instrumentality beliefs ( M = 5.08, SD = 1.44), control + belonging beliefs ( M = 4.06, SD = 1.65), and importance/negative beliefs ( M = 3.29, SD = 1.95).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection</head><p>The goal of this analysis was to select the five best performing messages to use in a subsequent message experiment (Study 3). As in the Message development sample, messages were ranked and selected based on the message effectiveness scores (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>). However, two messages in the top five targeting self-related beliefs (self_1 and self_3) were very similar. We therefore selected the simpler of these two messages along with the sixth most effective message to test in Study 3. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations between promising belief metrics and message effectiveness</head><p>Post-hoc analyses showed that percentage to gain and belief centrality were each uniquely positively associated with message effectiveness scores (Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S2</ref>). However, the relationship with belief centrality was approximately 2.5 times stronger (𝛽 = 0.44, 95% CI [0.28, 0.59], t (28.05) = 5.87, p &lt; .001) than with percentage to gain (𝛽 = 0.17, 95% CI [0.01, 0.34], t (26.81) = 2.14, p = .042). All statistics from this model, the models including argument and belief strength as outcomes, and model comparison metrics are reported in Supplementary Material Tables <ref type="table">S7-8</ref>. Belief text is abbreviated for visualization purposes. Alternative text for messages can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In Study 2, we developed and validated nonpartisan GOTV messages targeting promising beliefs identified in Study 1. We assessed message effectiveness in terms of argument (i.e., persuasiveness and effectiveness at motivating voting) and belief strength (i.e., elicitation of the promising belief targeted). In the Message development sample-a national sample of college students-self-related messages targeting behavioral beliefs about the self-relevance (e.g., "Voting is relevant to me personally") and instrumentality of voting (e.g., "Voting is a way I can advance the causes I care about") tended to be most effective, whereas informational messages targeting control beliefs ("It's too difficult or effortful to make a plan to vote") were the least effective. The effectiveness of messages targeting beliefs about duty (e.g., "Voting is my duty"), response efficacy (e.g., "Because of where I live and vote, my vote doesn't matter"), and belonging (e.g., "Voting makes me feel like I'm part of a community") were more variable.</p><p>Testing the subset of most effective messages from the Message developmental sample (and new messages targeting informational and social belonging beliefs together) in a local sample of college students revealed similar results. Even when combined with social themes, informational messages targeting control beliefs tended to perform the worst, both with respect to argument and belief strength. This is noteworthy given that prior research has explained low youth voter turnout in terms of informational barriers about how to vote (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Feldman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McDevitt &amp; Chaffee, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Syvertsen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bennion and Nickerson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">McKinney &amp; Banwart, 2005)</ref>. This suggests that while information is necessary-particularly among youth who have not had the opportunity to develop voting habits-it may not be sufficient to shift control beliefs about voting in ways that affect downstream voting intentions. From this sample, we selected five of the best performing messages to test in a subsequent message experiment.</p><p>We also conducted post-hoc analyses combining across samples to explore whether and how strongly promising belief metrics identified in Study 1 were related to message effectiveness ratings. We found that messages targeting beliefs with higher percentages to gain and centrality were also rated as more effective. Percentage to gain and centrality each independently predicted message effectiveness, highlighting their utility as complementary measures. However, belief centrality was more strongly associated with message effectiveness than percentage to gain, and also predicted both argument and belief strength, whereas percentage to gain only predicted belief strength. Together, these findings establish links between promising belief metrics and subsequent message effectiveness perceptions and further demonstrate the potential for network approaches to guide campaign development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3: Message experiment</head><p>In Study 3, we conducted an experiment with two primary aims. First, we sought to test the effectiveness of the co-designed GOTV messages targeting promising beliefs compared to existing youth-focused GOTV messages on social media from both national and local campaigns. Second, we sought to assess how well the GOTV messages co-designed with and for undergraduates our university would generalize to a national sample of college students. We chose to prioritize ecological validity over tight experimental control and selected existing messages on social media from Rock the Vote as national message controls. We focused on Rock the Vote because it is one of the oldest and best established nonpartisan national organizations focused on youth voter engagement and has substantial reach (Rock the Vote, 2025). Although our co-designed messages were persuasive, we also included informational messages since providing youth with voting information is a common strategy in youth-focused campaigns (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bennion &amp; Michelson, 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Feldman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">McKinney &amp; Banwart, 2005)</ref> and generic messages (e.g., an image of an "I voted" sticker) as a low-level control.</p><p>In our primary analyses, we predicted that across message types participants would rate the co-designed messages targeting promising voting beliefs ( co-designed messages ) as more motivating, persuasive, and self-relevant than messages from Rock the Vote ( control messages ). Considering each type of message separately, we expected that the co-designed messages would be more motivating, persuasive, and self-relevant than informational and generic control messages and at least or more motivating, persuasive, and self-relevant than persuasive control messages. To evaluate the impact of developing messages for our local audience using formative research, we also conducted supplementary analyses using existing messages generated by students from our GOTV partner organization as controls. The hypotheses and the analysis plan were preregistered before data collection ( <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/4jdxh">https://osf.io/4jdxh</ref> ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power</head><p>Our target sample size was determined by an a priori power analysis and found that a sample of 250 participants would be sufficient to detect a within-person condition difference (i.e., co-designed versus control messages) for an effect size of Cohen's d = 0.1 with &gt;80% power and d = 0.15 with &gt;99% power. We collected two samples-one local sample of students at our university and one national sample of college students-and aimed to recruit 250 participants in each. However, given the short timeline between the study launch and election day, we were only able to recruit 73 participants in the local sample. For this sample, we were powered to detect an effect of d = 0.17 with &gt;80% power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>In the Local sample, participants ( N = 72) were recruited from the student participant pool at the University of Pennsylvania and were eligible to participate if they were 18 or older, eligible to vote in the 2024 U.S. general election, and had not participated in Study 2. In the National sample, participants ( N = 251) were recruited from Prolific and were eligible to participate if they were college students in the U.S. between the ages of 18-22 and eligible to vote in the 2024 U.S. general election. Two participants in the national sample were excluded from analysis for reporting they were older than 25 (final N = 249).</p><p>Participants' ages were similar across the two samples (Local sample: M = 20.2, SD = 1.3; National sample: M = 20.4, SD = 1.4). In the Local sample, participants reported the following gender identities: 59.7% women, 38.9% men, 0% genderqueer, 0% non-binary, 1.4% preferred not to say, 0% preferred to self describe. The gender distribution was similar in the National sample: 57.0% women, 36.5% men, 0% genderqueer, 4.4% non-binary, 0.4% preferred not to say, 0.4% preferred to self describe.</p><p>In the Local sample, participants reported the following racial identities: 47.4% White, 22.4% East Asian, 11.8% Black or African American, 7.9% South Asian, 5.3% Southeast Asian, 2.6% Middle Eastern or North African, 0% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 0% other racial/ethnic identity not listed, 0% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). In addition, 8.3% of participants identified as Hispanic or Latina/o/x. The National sample included fewer Asian participants and more Black participants than the Local sample: 49.5% White, 10.1% East Asian, 21.3% Black or African American, 3.5% South Asian, 6.6% Southeast Asian, 1.0% Middle Eastern or North African, 2.4% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 3.1% other racial/ethnic identity, 0.7% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. In addition, more participants (19.3%) identified as Hispanic or Latina/o/x.</p><p>This study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board and participants gave informed consent. Participants in the Local sample were compensated via course credit for completing a 15-minute survey and participants in the National sample were compensated $2 for completing a 10-minute survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>For this experiment we used a within-subjects design in which each participant rated a subset of messages from all conditions. The experiment included two primary message types across both samples: messages targeting promising beliefs, co-designed with youth (co-designed messages) and a set of messages from a national nonpartisan GOTV organization, Rock the Vote (control messages). The control messages enabled us to compare our experimental messages with ecologically-valid, existing messages that also targeted youth but were presumably designed without insights from youth partners and formative research. In the Local sample, we also tested the co-designed messages against messages previously created and disseminated by our partner organization, Penn Leads the Vote (PLTV), that were designed by youth but did not target promising beliefs identified in formative research ("student control messages"). Results from these secondary analyses are reported in the Supplemental Material.</p><p>The co-designed messages consisted of 5 messages selected from Study 2 targeting beliefs about the self-relevance of voting (self-related beliefs) and the belief that an individual's vote matters (response efficacy beliefs). These messages aimed to influence participants' attitudes toward voting by highlighting personal significance and the impact of one's vote. Control messages were categorized as either generic messages (e.g., "Vote Vote Vote!" or images of "I voted" stickers), informational messages (messages that provide helpful instructions, such as how to complete mail-in ballots), or persuasive messages (messages that aim to motivate action by making an argument, e.g., "If you don't register, you can't vote. Which means you don't get a say in our democracy."). The control messages across both samples were derived from Rock the Vote 's Instagram posts shared between June and October of 2024. We selected 15 control messages that met the following criteria: (a) nonpartisan content, (b) classification as either generic, informational, or persuasive, (c) not targeting specific groups (e.g., Black voters or women voters), (d) not referencing expired deadlines (e.g., past voter registration deadlines), and (e) standalone graphics without captions or additional information. The 15 control messages included 5 generic messages, 5 informational messages, and 5 persuasive messages. All messages and alternative text can be found online: <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/axrc7">https://osf.io/axrc7</ref> .</p><p>In both samples, participants viewed the same set of 5 co-designed messages, as well as a random subset of 5 control messages sampled from the set of 15. All messages were presented in a randomized order. Participants used a sliding scale (0 = strongly disagree, 100 = strongly agree) to rate each message on three primary outcome measures: motivation to vote ("This message motivates me to vote"), persuasiveness ("This message is persuasive"), and self-relevance ("This message is relevant to me"). They also rated the messages on additional measures, described in Supplementary Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Our primary analyses tested the effect of message source (co-designed or control) on message motivation to vote, persuasiveness, and self-relevance collapsed across message types (persuasive, informational, or generic). For each outcome, we fit a separate linear mixed effects model regressing the dependent variable on the fixed effect of message source and intercepts were allowed to vary randomly across participants. To test whether the effect of message source varied by message type, we fit the same models within each message type separately. We checked each model for modeling assumption violations, including normality of residuals and heteroskedasticity. No assumptions were violated and no data transformations were performed. As preregistered, we did not exclude or transform any outliers. We conducted exploratory analyses to examine generalizability of messages from local to national samples by including sample and its interaction with message source as fixed effects. The following additional analyses are reported in Supplementary Material: preregistered secondary analyses examining student-generated control messages and sharing and emotions ratings across samples; sensitivity analyses controlling for aesthetic quality and nonpartisanship; and exploratory message-level analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary analyses</head><p>Across message types, we predicted that the co-designed messages targeting promising voting beliefs would be more motivating, persuasive, and self-relevant than control messages from Rock the Vote . We found strong evidence for all three hypotheses (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Compared to control messages, the co-designed messages were substantially more motivating ( b = 14.58, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [12.97,</ref><ref type="bibr">16.19]</ref>) and persuasive <ref type="bibr">( b = 16.68,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [15.03,</ref><ref type="bibr">18.32]</ref>), and moderately more self-relevant ( b = 6.70, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[5.18, 8.24]</ref>). Examining potential differences between message types, we found as expected that the co-designed messages were more motivating and persuasive than generic, informational, and persuasive control messages. However, the co-designed messages were only more self-relevant than generic and persuasive control messages but not informational control messages. Statistics for all models are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. Sensitivity analyses controlling for nonpartisanship and aesthetic quality of the messages slightly weakened the magnitude of the experimental effects, but all remained statistically significant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S12</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student control message analyses</head><p>In the Local sample, we also compared our co-designed messages targeting promising voting beliefs against prior messages created independently by the student-led GOTV organization on campus who we partnered with as a set of secondary control messages. In line with preregistered hypotheses, compared to student messages created without a theoretical framework across message types, the co-designed messages were more motivating ( b = 8.03, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [4.87,</ref><ref type="bibr">11.18]</ref>, t (613.36) = 5.00, p &lt; .001) and persuasive ( b = 11.00, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [7.51,</ref><ref type="bibr">14.49]</ref>, t (618.07) = 6.19, p &lt; .001), and similarly were self-relevant ( b = -2.83, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-5.99, 0.33]</ref>, t (622.49) = 1.76, p = .080). Model statistics and the results for each message type separately are included in more detail in Supplemental Materials (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S13</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In Study 3, we used a within-subject experimental design to determine the degree to which co-designing GOTV messages targeting promising voting beliefs in partnership with the target population increased message-related motivation, persuasion and self-relevance. We found evidence of substantial benefits to conducting formative research and tailoring messages to promising beliefs relevant to the target population. We also found that our co-designed messages were more motivating and persuasive than prior messages that were designed by members of the target population (via our student-led, campus partner) but without drawing on evidence-based insights from formative research. Therefore, these results highlight the importance of integrating theory-driven formative research with participatory co-design practices with members of the target population, to develop effective GOTV messages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General discussion</head><p>Despite expressing high levels of political concern, young adults remain underrepresented at the polls. This work sought to develop effective communication strategies to address this longstanding gap in young Americans' civic life. Across three studies, we integrated formative research methods with a participatory co-design approach to develop and test get-out-the-vote (GOTV) messages targeting youth-specific voting beliefs. In the first study, we mapped beliefs associated with voting and identified promising beliefs that were strongly correlated with voting intentions and had the greatest opportunities for belief change through communication campaigns using standard methods. In exploratory network analyses, we also considered the relationships among these beliefs and demonstrated that network methods can be used as a complementary approach to identify influential beliefs in formative research. In the second study, we iteratively co-designed and tested messages to develop a set of messages that effectively targeted promising beliefs. Finally, the third study demonstrated that in both local and national samples, our top co-designed messages targeting key promising beliefs about the personal relevance and impact of voting were consistently rated as more motivating, persuasive, and personally relevant than messages designed by a prominent national youth-focused GOTV organization, Rock the Vote, and as more motivating and persuasive than prior messages made by our local student-led GOTV organization partner. Together, these findings illustrate the promise of integrating theory-driven, formative research and human-centered, participatory approaches to develop messaging campaigns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formative research to identify promising voting beliefs</head><p>Building on standard message campaign development frameworks <ref type="bibr">(Fishbein &amp; Capella, 2006)</ref>, this project used two novel approaches to conduct formative research-participatory elicitation methods to generate beliefs and network analyses to identify influential beliefs. Our research was grounded in the Reasoned Action Approach and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. Prior work has applied TPB to youth voting, but used single-item summary measures assessing attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control and did not consider upstream beliefs shaping these perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Glasford, 2008)</ref>. Other work has considered beliefs about voting but has not systematically compared them in the context of TPB. We addressed these gaps by generating a large battery of beliefs through a participatory research process with student partners. Although many of these beliefs could be classified as control, normative, or behavioral beliefs, others were more nuanced and cut across categories (e.g., beliefs about social impacts of the election)-which was reflected in the network analysis, showing a mix of normative and behavioral beliefs in several clusters. While TPB does not define belief categories as mutually exclusive, these results highlight the importance of considering relationships among beliefs and suggest that data-driven network approaches can inform message design according to principles such as network control or activation spillover <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brandt &amp; Sleegers, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The nuanced set of beliefs elicited in formative research was made possible by our student partner's input and led to the identification of numerous promising voting beliefs that could be targeted in GOTV messaging.

Considering the relationships among beliefs was motivated in part by the observation that messages targeting less promising beliefs can still be effective if they are correlated with more promising beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lee et al., 2016)</ref>. We found that belief centrality was positively associated with correlations with voting intentions, suggesting its viability as a metric to identify promising beliefs. Critically, belief centrality and percentage to gain were not correlated and some beliefs had notable discrepancies between these metrics. In particular, control beliefs and negative beliefs related to disillusionment had high percentages to gain, but low centrality. These messages also tended to be the least effective in Study 2, underscoring that belief centrality may add value beyond standard methods. In line with this, we also found that the most effective messages targeted beliefs with high network centrality. Direct comparisons of percentage to gain and belief centrality further reinforced this idea by showing that belief centrality was a stronger predictor of message effectiveness than belief centrality. Based on these results, future research can be designed to more explicitly test the following predictions: compared to messages targeting less central beliefs, messages targeting more central beliefs should be more effective and more strongly influence other beliefs leading to greater network-level belief change. Future research can also compare the utility of percentage to gain and network centrality to guide message development by comparing messages targeting beliefs with high percentage to gain but low centrality and vice versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Message effects</head><p>Many of the promising beliefs we identified were amenable to being targeted in nonpartisan messaging. Mirroring the results from our formative research, the most effective messages aimed to help people identify why voting is relevant to them, why their vote matters, and how the outcome of the election might affect them and people they care about. For example, the two most effective messages included "myth-busting" the insignificance of one's vote and encouraging the audience to connect voting to one's values without specifying particular policy positions. In contrast, social and informational messages about registering and voting were less effective, even when combined. We observed further evidence in the message experiment that informational messages are perceived as self-relevant but not motivating. This is an important insight because information and knowledge barriers are consistently highlighted in youth voting research <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Maiello et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Harder &amp; Krosnick, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Knoester &amp; Kretz, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Knoester &amp; Gichiru, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kawashima-Ginsburg and Kiesa, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bergan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">CIRCLE, 2022)</ref>, are frequently discussed in social media messaging <ref type="bibr">(Ad Council, 2020)</ref>, and may feel like safer targets for nonpartisan GOTV organizations and nonprofits that must avoid perceptions of partisanship (Alliance for Justice, 2024; Nonprofit VOTE, 2024). Our findings demonstrate that GOTV messages can be motivating when targeting beliefs about the personal relevance of voting without evoking partisan cues and without focusing on single issues. By naming multiple issues and without specifying positions about them, these messages struck a balance between persuasiveness and nonpartisanship.</p><p>Co-designing these messages in partnership with students from the student-led, nonpartisan GOTV organization on campus (PLTV) in ways that combined their expertise with theory-driven frameworks increased message effectiveness. By integrating insights from behavior change and communication theory with lived experience and local knowledge from student partners, we developed messages that successfully targeted promising beliefs. This co-design process created messages that were perceived as more motivating, persuasive, and self-relevant than existing social media messages from Rock the Vote, a national nonpartisan GOTV organization aimed at (but not directed by) youth. We also found that our co-designed messages were more effective than messages previously created by our partner organization, PLTV (i.e., messages that were designed by youth but were not theory-driven and did not aim to target promising beliefs). Although we do not know how the Rock the Vote messages were developed (i.e., whether they were evidence-based or had input from youth) and therefore cannot make inferences about specific mechanisms, our findings demonstrate that the integration of theory-driven formative research and participatory co-design practices in partnership with the target audience is a fruitful framework for campaign development <ref type="bibr">(Kikut-Stein et al. 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">2024b)</ref>. More broadly, this framework dovetails with recent calls to leverage youth expertise in the design and implementation of research-based GOTV interventions for more effective tailoring and to support youth civic engagement <ref type="bibr">(Cosme et al., Under review.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Michelson &amp; Ostfeld, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Critically, the co-design process created messages that were effective in our local context but also generalized beyond it. We found that the co-designed messages were equally effective in a national sample of college students, indicating that the promising beliefs we identified and the messages we developed targeting them were broadly relevant to college students. This finding is consistent with recent work applying YPAR approaches in health communication showing formative research and message development conducted locally can generalize nationally <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kikut-Stein et al, 2024b)</ref>. This evidence underscores the feasibility of using this approach to develop GOTV messaging campaigns that can be implemented locally while simultaneously generating generalizable scientific knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>These findings advance theory in political communication in several ways. First, it establishes the use of belief centrality as a complementary method for identifying promising beliefs to target in communication interventions and messaging campaigns. It extends gold-standard approaches like the Hornik and Woolf method to take into account relationships among beliefs-a previously identified limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lee et al., 2016)</ref>-and provides a similarly actionable ranking metric to guide belief selection and message design. Second, the data-driven network analyses add nuance to Reasoned Action Approaches like the Theory of Planned Behavior highlighting the interconnections among normative and behavioral beliefs. At least in the context of voting beliefs, normative and behavioral beliefs tended to cluster together rather than being segregated into separate clusters as might be predicted by theory. Similarly, self-related and social beliefs also tended to cluster together, mirroring previous findings that self-related and social motives are tightly linked in the context of message perception and sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Cosme et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Cosme et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr">Falk &amp; Scholz, 2017)</ref>. Third, these findings add further evidence that communication interventions that increase the salience of self-related and social motives can encourage prosocial behavior, such as voting, and information sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Albarracín et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cosme et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Costa et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">French Bourgeois &amp; de la Sablonnière, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sinclair et al., 2025)</ref>. Importantly, our results suggest that at least in the context of youth voting, it may be more effective to target self-related beliefs, which can in turn activate social beliefs, as opposed to targeting social beliefs since the messages targeting social beliefs tended to be less effective. Finally, our results underscore how social norms and values like a sense of civic duty can be internalized so that they become core personal values <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bali et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lydic et al., 2025)</ref>. Appeals to civic duty <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gerber &amp; Green, 2017)</ref> and normative social pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gerber et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Panagopoulos, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Rogers et al., 2017)</ref> are common in GOTV campaigns, but have the potential to backfire if they are perceived as controlling. Our findings suggest that communication interventions that help individuals identify why voting is aligned with their core values is another pathway to activate a sense of civic duty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>Beyond theoretical advancements, this project also has clear implications for practitioners seeking to develop youth-focused GOTV messaging. This research demonstrates that it is possible to develop persuasive and motivating GOTV messages that are nonpartisan by targeting promising beliefs in open-ended ways that allow the audience to reflect on the issues most relevant to themselves and their communities. It also indicates that communication interventions should go beyond simply providing informational content to overcome psychological barriers to voting. These results suggest that targeting behavioral beliefs about the personal relevance and importance of voting, the significance of an individual vote, and the impact the election will have on personally-relevant issues and outcomes may be impactful. Overall, we found that beliefs about the self-relevance and importance of voting and the personal consequences of the election tended to be the most promising and influential. Therefore, GOTV messaging campaigns and communication interventions that help individuals connect the act of voting to their core values and concerns may have greater potential to strengthen voting intentions.</p><p>This project also highlights the synergistic potential of adopting an iterative, participatory research approach to conduct formative research and co-design messages in partnership with youth. From a practical standpoint, scaling nonpartisan GOTV efforts requires strategically targeting beliefs about voting, particularly pertaining to the self-relevance of voting and voter efficacy, while ensuring clarity, minimal partisan cues, strong visuals, and authenticity through community-based design. We demonstrate that this approach can yield better political communication interventions while simultaneously serving as an opportunity to strengthen youth research skills and support civic education, development, and empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ozer et al., 2024)</ref>. As was the case in our team, this framework can also create opportunities for noncitizen students to promote nonpartisan civic engagement. In sum, engaging in participatory action research in partnership with youth can lead to more effective political communication interventions and also create a positive culture of civic efficacy and collaboration between youth and adult researchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future directions</head><p>These promising findings should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, we cannot disentangle the two key features of our design process-formative research and message development-to determine the impact of each process in isolation. Rather, we show that co-design in the process of formative research and message development led to substantially better message effectiveness. Second, we focused on message-related perceptions and voting intentions rather than voting-related behavior (e.g., registration and voting). Although we did not directly measure voting behavior, the robust effects observed here suggest that theory-informed, co-designed communication interventions hold promise in closing the gap between concern about politics, intentions to vote, and actual voting behavior. In line with this, a recent field experiment showed that messages communicating the personal impact of voting increased voter turnout in a local election <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Huber et al., 2022)</ref>. Future research could investigate whether these immediate message-related effects translate into meaningful, lasting changes in voter registration or turnout. Third, we used controlled experimental methods to investigate message effectiveness and therefore cannot draw inferences about how effective these messages would be in situ. Research using field study methods to evaluate message effectiveness on real social media platforms is an important future direction, especially since prior research on GOTV campaigns targeting youth on social media have yielded mixed results <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Unan et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Teresi &amp; Michelson, 2015)</ref>. Fourth, we applied the belief network approach post-hoc and therefore future studies should examine its ability to guide identification of promising beliefs and message development from the outset. Fifth, although our samples were adequately powered for all analyses presented here, they precluded deeper exploration of demographic and individual differences in voting beliefs and message effects; future studies designed for this purpose would provide important contextual information to inform youth-focused GOTV campaigns. Finally, we collaborated with college students to design GOTV messages to motivate their peers to vote but did not test the degree to which voting beliefs and messages generalize to youth not enrolled in college. This is an important future direction as this group is contacted frequently by GOTV campaigns (CIRCLE, 2022) and therefore may especially benefit from receiving and shaping the development of GOTV communication interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In a political climate where young adults are often characterized as disengaged, this study demonstrates the potential for theory-based, co-created messaging to bolster motivation to vote in this group. By integrating formative research with participatory co-design, we developed messages that outperformed national youth-focused communication campaigns in their immediate psychological impact. These promising findings testify to the reciprocal benefits of combining theoretical rigor with the lived insights of the communities that campaigns aim to engage. In doing so, they offer a blueprint for communication scholars, practitioners, and civic organizations seeking to catalyze meaningful engagement among emerging generations of voters. Crucially, research partnerships between these groups creates a framework that enables rapid translation of research into direct implementation, which in turn can inform the next cycle of research through insights gained from implementation. As civic and educational organizations look to scale their efforts, embedding co-design throughout the research and delivery pipeline offers a clear path toward messages that are at once persuasive, portable, and powerfully rooted in community experience.</p><p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Voting is an important part of being civically engaged 154 120 56.2 Voting impacts policies and other outcomes I care

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations between promising belief metrics and message effectiveness</head><p>We conducted post-hoc analyses examining relationships between percentage to gain and belief centrality for the beliefs targeted in each message and message effectiveness. The primary and secondary beliefs targeted by each message are listed for each message on OSF: <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/axrc7">https://osf.io/axrc7</ref> . We combined data from the Message development and testing samples and averaged centrality and percentage to gain across all beliefs targeted in each message to get a single value for each, per message. We then fit linear mixed effects models regressing each measure of message effectiveness (composite effectiveness score, argument strength, and belief strength) on all potential models including the fixed effects of centrality and percentage to gain (i.e., main effects of each separately, main effects of both, and the interaction between them), as well as intercept only models.

Across message types, we found that there were no statistically significant differences between the Local and National student samples (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). The National sample rated the control messages as slightly more motivating ( b = 5.58, p = .067), but the difference between co-designed and control messages were similar in magnitude ( b s = -0.82 --1.68, p s &gt; .05). That is, there were no statistically significant interactions between message source and sample, indicating that the co-designed messages were similarly effective for college students locally and nationally. </p></div>

We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to compare models and treated a decrease in AIC of at least 2 points to be considered a better fitting model. When two models had less than a 2-point difference, we interpret the more expansive model. Model comparisons are reported in Table <ref type="table">S7</ref> and results from the best fitting models are reported in Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>. For illustrative purposes, model fitted predictions from the models that include the main effects of both percentage to gain and belief centrality are visualized in Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>.</p><p>The best fitting models either only included belief centrality or the main effects of both centrality and percentage to gain. In all models, belief centrality was the strongest predictor of message effectiveness. The best fitting model for argument strength did not include percentage to gain and this measure was not associated with argument strength (Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary analyses: Message sharing and affective responses to messages</head><p>In preregistered secondary analyses, we investigated the effect of message source (co-designed vs. control) on message sharing and affect. Models were fit using the same approach described in the main manuscript. We expected that participants would have higher intentions to broadcast-share widely such as on social media-and narrowcast-share with specific individuals-the co-designed messages compared to the control messages. In line with this hypothesis, we found that the co-designed messages elicited slightly stronger broad-and narrowcast sharing intentions than control messages (Table <ref type="table">S11</ref>). With respect to affective ratings, we expected that the co-designed messages would evoke more positive emotion than the control messages. We did not preregister a hypothesis about negative emotion, but include this as an exploratory outcome. We found that co-designed messages evoked both more positive and negative emotions than control messages (Table <ref type="table">S11</ref>). Sensitivity analyses: Controlling for aesthetic quality and nonpartisanship</p><p>We conducted sensitivity analyses including aesthetic quality and nonpartisan ratings in the primary models reported in the main manuscript. Controlling for these variables reduced the magnitude of the message source effects, but all remain statistically significant (Table <ref type="table">S12</ref>). This exploratory analysis aimed to identify which messages were most effective overall. We fit a linear mixed effects model regressing each outcome separately on the fixed effect of message; intercepts were allowed to vary randomly across participants. Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref> shows the marginal effects for each message. All co-designed messages were rated as motivating, persuasive, and self-relevant (i.e., means are &gt;50, the scale midpoint), whereas control messages tended to be rated as not motivating and not persuasive. Overall, the co-designed messages tended to be the most motivating and persuasive, but results were more mixed for self-relevance. The most motivating and persuasive message targeted the belief that an individual's vote doesn't matter. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preregistered secondary analyses: Student control messages</head><p>In the Local sample, we also tested a set of secondary control messages that were obtained from an internal repository of prior social media posts from Penn Leads the Vote, a student-led GOTV organization at our institution. The purpose of including these messages was to compare the effectiveness of our messages that were co-designed with youth and targeted promising beliefs, relative to messages that were designed by youth but without evidence-based belief targeting. These secondary control messages were evaluated for inclusion based on the same criteria as our primary control messages from Rock the Vote. This resulted in 10 secondary control messages, including 5 generic messages, 3 informational messages, and 2 persuasive messages. In addition to the co-designed and Rock the Vote control messages, participants in the Local sample saw an additional random sample of 5 out of 10 secondary control messages.</p><p>We expected that the student control messages would be more self-relevant since they are tailored to the Local sample, and thus predicted that the co-designed messages would be more motivating and persuasive than the student control message and at least as self-relevant. In line with these preregistered hypotheses, we found that compared to the student control messages across message types, the co-designed messages were more motivating and persuasive, and were similarly self-relevant (Table <ref type="table">S13</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref>). As expected, we also found that the co-designed messages were more motivating and persuasive than all message types. However, in contrast to our predictions, the co-designed messages were rated as less self-relevant than persuasive and informational messages, and similarly self-relevant as generic messages.  We also conducted analyses examining our secondary outcomes of interest. As in the primary analyses, the co-designed messages evoked more negative emotion than the control messages (Table <ref type="table">S14</ref>). In contrast to the primary analyses, participants reported lower narrowcast sharing intentions for the co-designed compared to the student control messages. Co-designed and student control messages elicited similar broadcast sharing intentions and positive emotions. </p></div>			</div>
