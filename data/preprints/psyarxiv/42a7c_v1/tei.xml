<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We examine whether classic opinion-dynamics models can be strengthened by grounding their core parameters in psychological domain knowledge. First, we fielded a preregistered survey experiment in Germany (N = 1,804) that mimics a single ABM updating step. Participants reported justice-relevant traits, empathy, ambiguity tolerance, justice sensitivity, and moral indignation, then engaged with counter-attitudinal content. From these data we estimated generalized linear models linking traits to two Hegselmann-Krause parameters: the confidence bound c (openness to differing opinions) and the self-influence weight m (inverse to susceptibility to influence). Empirically, a subset of theorized links was supported: cognitive empathy widened c, moral indignation narrowed c, and victim-oriented justice sensitivity increased m. We then calibrated a bounded-confidence ABM with these mappings and evaluated it against four canonical polarization findings. The empirically informed model substantially improved qualitative replication of group extremization and signed directional change under mixed evidence, matched the backfire contrast as good as the baseline, and, like the baseline, failed to reproduce a superlinear polarization slope. These results show how justice-focused traits, particularly empathy and moral indignation, provide a parsimonious, data-driven bridge from micro-level psychology to macro-level polarization dynamics, while also revealing limits that motivate extensions (e.g., identity cues and framing) in future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Classic models of opinion dynamics capture how beliefs change through local interaction, but they often abstract away from the rich mechanisms documented in the social sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bramson et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Smaldino (2023)</ref>. We argue that such models can be strengthened by explicitly grounding their core mechanisms in psychological domain knowledge. Here, we do so in four steps: (1) we develop a theoretical link between four justice-relevant traits, empathy, ambiguity tolerance, justice sensitivity and moral indignation, and the micro-processes that drive opinion change; (2) we test these links in an empirical study designed to mimic a single updating step in an agent-based model (ABM), estimating how the traits shape openness to differing opinions and susceptibility to influence; (3) we feed the resulting empirical associations into a classic ABM by mapping traits to its key parameters; and (4) we evaluate whether this empirically informed ABM better reproduces canonical polarization findings than a baseline version of the same model that omits the social-science layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Societal Polarization</head><p>Explaining polarization is vital given its societal relevance. The increasing polarization of societies has become a central concern for both scientific research and public discourse, as evidenced by its growing prominence in academic literature and the media <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kreiss &amp; McGregor, 2024)</ref>.This interest results from the fact that polarization, among other things, threatens democracy and social cohesion (Kish <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bar-On et al., 2024)</ref>, it threatens citizens' willingness to compromise and interact with one another(Kish <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bar-On et al., 2024)</ref>, and it fosters the distribution of fake news within a population <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cole et al., 2025)</ref>. Scholars and policymakers alike are engaged in ongoing debates about how to measure polarization, uncover its drivers, predict its evolution, evaluate its societal consequences, and design interventions to mitigate its adverse effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berntzen et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cakanlar, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pereira et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wagner, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Explaining polarization plausibly requires considering interindividual differences that foster it <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Devia, Giordano, et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Nyhan &amp; Reifler, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Schweighofer et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Taber &amp; Lodge, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, high neuroticism and low agreeableness increase polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lou &amp; Xu, 2025)</ref>, high levels of intellectual humility decrease it <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowes &amp; Tasimi, 2025)</ref>. Given the limited attention paid to such effects in the modeling community, we investigated whether personality traits, especially those with a strong interpersonal component, can predict societal polarization. If such traits, including empathy, tolerance of ambiguity, justice sensitivity and moral indignation, are shown to influence opinion dynamics, they could enhance our ability to forecast polarization trajectories across contexts for which reliable psychological data are available.</p><p>More specifically, we contribute to the literature on issue polarization, which refers to the extent to which societal opinions are distributed across extremes of an ideological spectrum. Issue polarization is marked by bimodal or multimodal opinion distributions, with peaks drifting towards the more extreme points <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bramson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">DiMaggio et al., 1996)</ref>. Such multimodality can affect concrete democratic outcomes such as voter turnout, electoral volatility, satisfaction with democracy, and the likelihood of political or even violent conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dalton, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Esteban &amp; Schneider, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hoerner &amp; Hobolt, 2020)</ref>. Understanding the antecedents, mechanisms, and consequences of opinion polarization is thus crucial for diagnosing democratic vulnerabilities and designing policy responses that reinforce democratic resilience. We aim to extend this understanding by linking polarization to individual-level psychological characteristics and embedding these relationships within a dynamic simulation model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Foundations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Agent-Based Modeling and the Integration of Social Science Domain Knowledge</head><p>There are several reasons for adding more psychological characteristics to dynamic simulation models. The growing complexity of societal polarization has rendered overly simplistic, physics-inspired (spin-like) models of social behavior insufficient for capturing the richness of human interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Franceschetti et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sobkowicz, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Squazzoni, 2023)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Schweighofer et al. (2020)</ref> emphasized, many models in sociophysics rely on ad-hoc assumptions that fail to account for the multifaceted drivers of individual and group-level decision-making. To address this limitation, the integration of social science domain knowledge, such as empirical findings from sociology, psychology, political science, and economics, into agent-based modeling (ABM) has become essential for predicting, steering, and modifying collective behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alizadeh et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kalvas et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Including social science domain knowledge in generative models improves the ecological validity of, for example, generative mechanisms and agent heterogeneity. As an example, simulating fear-driven behavior during crises can be more credibly executed using psychological constructs rather than arbitrary rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Horned &amp; Vanhée, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kish Bar-On et al., 2024)</ref>. This increased ecological validity of generative processes makes model processes and predictions easier to translate to real-world scenarios, which is helpful in cases in which models claim to model real-world human interactions, as in the example of fear-driven behavior. Basing generative mechanisms on social science domain knowledge is particularly relevant when causal processes involve social science variables such as preferences, normative constructs, or socio-cognitive biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Renzini et al., 2023)</ref>. Adding social science domain knowledge to dynamic simulation models can also be a way to realistically model heterogeneity. ABMs informed by domain knowledge allow for heterogeneous agent modeling, incorporating traits such as cognitive biases, identity-based motivations, and emotion-driven decision-making. Implementing such traits leads to greater behavioral realism, which is critical for explaining and intervening in social phenomena.</p><p>The utility of ABMs informed by social science domain knowledge can also be considered from a social science perspective: It extends to data-poor or ethically sensitive contexts where direct experimentation is infeasible. In such settings, social science informed models provide a rigorous framework for exploring policy alternatives, such as in health access or alcohol regulation scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Renzini et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sgouros, 2023)</ref>. Importantly, these models do not only apply existing theory, they also generate new theoretical insights. Approaches such as inverse Generative Social Science (iGSS) illustrate how empirically calibrated simulations can help revise and refine behavioral theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Plähn et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, social science insights are indispensable for addressing structural limitations in current modeling paradigms. For example, models of opinion dynamics that rely solely on attraction/repulsion mechanics often fail to replicate the multimodal distribution of real-world political opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Squazzoni, 2023)</ref>. By incorporating constructs like network topology, identity formation, and differentiated influence mechanisms, ABMs can more accurately represent complex political landscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chattoe-Brown, 2023)</ref>. Thus, integration of social science domain knowledge greatly advances scientific robustness and policy relevance in computational modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Secchi, 2023)</ref>. Recent publications demonstrate a shift in the modeling community towards investigating the role of personality traits in shaping susceptibility to polarization. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lou and Xu (2025)</ref> use agents embodying the Big Five trait of personality (e.g., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) to model disinformation spread, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Muhammad and Kasahara (2024)</ref> explore the interaction between personality, trust, and information dissemination. Both demonstrate that polarization is deeply rooted in psychological variation. Similarly, We show how incorporating psychological constructs from justice research into a Hegselmann-Krause model improves the model's ecological validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justice Research and Personality in Polarization Dynamics</head><p>In fact, justice-related emotions and cognitions are central to affective polarization, defined as negative emotional responses to outgroups <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gollwitzer &amp; van Prooijen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kish Bar-On et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Peter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saveski et al., 2022)</ref>. The perception of injustice triggers strong emotional reactions, such as anger, moral indignation, or resentment, and motivates efforts to restore justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gollwitzer &amp; van Prooijen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Peter et al., 2013)</ref>, all of which are linked to increased affective polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crockett, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dagnes, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jahnke et al., 2020)</ref>. Not only do justice-related traits relate to affective polarization, there also is first evidence linking these traits to issue polarization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cole et al. (2025)</ref> report that issue polarization is shaped by differing moral foundations: conservatives often emphasize binding values (loyalty, authority), whereas liberals emphasize individualizing values (care, fairness).</p><p>Given these findings regarding justice-related traits and (mostly affective) polarization, we postulate that similar associations occur for issue polarization. Moreover, by modeling the traits' influence on polarization in a Hegselmann-Krause model, we can effectively calibrate the model to better match empirical polarization patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling Justice-Relevant Traits in Polarization</head><p>We propose a modified Hegselmann-Krause model in which two central parameters, confidence bound (c) and self-influence (m), are calibrated by regressing them on four justice-relevant personality traits: empathy, ambiguity tolerance, justice sensitivity, and moral indignation. These traits determine how open an agent is to opposing viewpoints (as displayed by parameter c) and how easily their opinions are susceptible to influence (as displayed by parameter m).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empathy</head><p>is defined as the ability to vicariously understand and emotionally resonate with another's internal state <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davis, 1983)</ref>. Perspective-taking, the cognitive component of empathy, enhances reflective political reasoning and openness to differing opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Muradova, 2021)</ref>. Empathetic listening increases attitudinal clarity and reduces prejudice during disagreements <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Weinstein &amp; Itzchakov, 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Empathetic concern, the affective component, is also a strong predictor of tolerance, particularly in controversial or emotionally charged dialogues <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Butrus &amp; Witenberg, 2013)</ref>. We therefore predict that both cognitive and affective empathy are positively associated with openness for differing opinions, i.e., parameter c.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ambiguity Tolerance</head><p>describes comfort with uncertainty and novel information <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Budner, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Litman, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Higher tolerance is associated with openness to differing opinions and reduced cognitive rigidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Luzsa &amp; Mayr, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Salvi et al., 2023)</ref>. In contrast, low ambiguity tolerance correlates with black-and-white thinking and heightened xenophobic attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Furnham &amp; Marks, 2013)</ref>. We therefore predict that ambiguity tolerance also are positively associated with openness for differing opinions, i.e., parameter c.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justice Sensitivity</head><p>refers to heightened sensitivity to perceived injustice, distinguishable across victim, observer, beneficiary, and perpetrator orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Schmitt et al., 2010)</ref>. Observer sensitivity promotes prosocial behavior and openness to differing opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baumert et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bondü et al., 2022)</ref>, while victim sensitivity is often linked to defensiveness, social withdrawal, and low receptivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bondü et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Following previous findings, we assume that specifically justice sensitivity from the observer and victim perspectives can help predict agents' behavior. We predict that high justice sensitivity from the observer perspective is positively associated with openness for differing opinions, i.e., parameter c, whereas justice sensitivity from the victim perspective is negatively associated with the degree of susceptibility to influence (and therefore positively to the self-influence parameter m).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moral Indignation</head><p>is defined as strong emotional arousal in response to perceived moral violations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Haidt et al., 2003)</ref>. In addition to being defined as a state variable, Disposition for moral indignation can also be measured as a personality trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bernhardt, 2000)</ref>. In this case, it reflects how quickly people tend to become morally indignant in ambiguous situations. While appropriate in response to dignity violations, excessive or mismatched moral indignation can fuel polarization and reduce conversational openness <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lück &amp; Nardi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Neuhäuser, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Nyhan &amp; Reifler, 2010)</ref>. Given these findings, we predict that moral indignation is negatively associated with the openness for differing opinions, i.e., parameter c, reinforcing opinion rigidity and resistance to disconfirming evidence. Thus, higher empathy and ambiguity tolerance increase c, making agents more open to diverse inputs. Justice sensitivity modulates both c and m, with orientation-specific effects, and moral indignation typically reduces c.</p><p>To test the applicability of a model enriched in this way, we compare the model's prediction with four established findings in research on polarization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Four Findings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moscovici and Zavalloni (1969)</head><p>Conducted with small discussion groups in late-1960s France, participants privately rated attitude targets (e.g., public figures, out-groups), discussed them, and then rated the targets again.</p><p>Polarization was operationalized as group extremization: post-discussion means shifted further away from the neutral point, and a higher share of individuals moved toward the group's prior direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lord, Ross and Lepper (1979)</head><p>Initially pro-and anti-capital-punishment participants were exposed to mixed evidence (both supportive and critical studies). Polarization was operationalized as divergent change: proponents became more favorable while opponents became less favorable, assessed with mean difference scores and corresponding t-tests by initial stance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Taber and Lodge (2006).</head><p>In the mid-2000s U.S. political context, participants evaluated balanced pro and con arguments on controversial issues while their prior attitudes were recorded. Polarization was operationalized as biased assimilation: post-treatment extremity increasing with a regression slope of post on pre extremity exceeding 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bail et al. (2018)</head><p>U.S. partisans were incentivized to follow a Twitter bot that retweeted messages from ideological opponents for about a month. Polarization was operationalized as movement in issue positions relative to baseline: cross-cutting exposure produced "backfire," i.e., shifts away from the out-party and toward more extreme in-party-consistent views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p>Synthesizing the theoretical rationale and the mechanisms distilled from classic polarization studies, we posit that justice-related dispositions systematically modulate the two core parameters of the Hegselmann-Krause model, agents' confidence bound c (openness to differing opinions) and self-influence m (inverse to susceptibility to influence). If these traits shape who listens to whom (c) and how strongly opinions are updated once interaction occurs (m), then trait-informed ABMs should reproduce empirical polarization signatures more faithfully than a baseline model without trait influences. We therefore state and test the following hypotheses: H1 There are empirical associations between justice-related traits and agent parameters c and m. The survey experiment was built so that it followed the mechanisms of a single updating step in the opinion-dynamics ABM. The design and analysis plan were preregistered on Oct 16, 2023 at the OSF, (<ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/SK274">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/SK274</ref>). In addition to assessing relevant personality traits, the experiment included an intervention in which self-influence and external influence were simulated. We used the data from the experiment to determine the range and distributions of the relevant agent traits, agent' confidence bounds, as well as their interaction with each other. This data was then used to calibrate the ABM so that the baseline distributions of all character traits were realistic and that the individual part of agents' parameters c and m could be predicted by their traits. The online survey was conducted from 17.01.24 to 05.02.24 via the panel provider Bilendi and included N = 1804 complete datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>The sample was stratified to be roughly representative of the German population. Relevant sociodemographics are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and Measures</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates the procedure. Participants first filled out the questionnaires for the personality traits. Participants rated all personality traits on a 6-point answering scale with the endpoints labeled as does not apply at all and fully applies. The exact and original German wording of all items can be found in the online supplemental material. We measured empathy with the short version of the Basic Empathy Scale (BES; original scale in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jolliffe and</ref><ref type="bibr">Farrington, 2006, short version in Oliva Delgado et al., 2011</ref>, in the German translation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Heynen et al., 2016)</ref>. The short version of this scale consists of nine items, of which four items measure affective empathy and five items measure cognitive empathy. The scale showed acceptable internal consistency, α cognitive = .725 and α af f ective = .723.</p><p>Ambiguity tolerance was measured with a modified scale by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Maes et al. (1996)</ref>. In the original version, this scale consists of five items which describe ambiguity intolerance, in our study we extended the scale by five inversely formulated items measuring ambiguity tolerance. The subscales showed acceptable internal consistency, α intolerance = .63 and α tolerance = .68 and small correlation between the subscales r = .06, p = .011.</p><p>Justice sensitivity from the observer and victim perspective were measured by the corresponding items by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schmitt et al. (2010)</ref>, with ten items each. The scales showed excellent internal consistencies, α victim = .91 and α observer = .93 and correlated moderately r = .57, p &lt; .001.</p><p>Disposition for moral indignation was a self-constructed scale, which we validated in three previous studies. The scale consists of 17 items, five of which ask for general self-assessment regarding disposition for moral indignation, and 12 which assess thoughts and behavior that could be indicative of moral indignation in reference to a specific situation (e.g., a stranger disregarding commonly known rules). In the three validation studies (n 1 = 96, n 2 = 147, n 3 = 197), the entire scale showed excellent internal consistencies α 1 = 0.82, α 2 = .89 and α 3 = .92. The internal consistency in this study was also excellent, α = .85.</p><p>The measures for participants' traits were followed by a rating of an opinion on a controversial topic and opinion certainty. In order to have participants' opinions on a real-world issue, we asked them to rate their opinion on migration in Germany. This opinion was measured on a 10-point scale with the endpoints labeled as I am someone who rejects migration in Germany and I am someone who supports migration in Germany, in addition, all gradations on the scale were numbered from 1 to 10.</p><p>To quantify c, i.e., the participants' confidence bound, participants were shown the opinion scale again and asked to select all those opinions that they would be willing to have a conversation with. c was then recorded as the percentage of the scale selected (i.e., only one number selected = 10% or 0.1, all numbers selected = 100% or 1)</p><p>The experiment then entailed an intervention in two parts: In the first part of the intervention, we induced the self-influence part of a typical ABM by asking participants to please elaborate on their opinion. Participants had to write at least 30 characters before they could continue with the survey.</p><p>The parameter m, i.e., participant's individual self-influence, was derived from the texts that participants wrote, by sorting them onto the opinion scale the same way as the previously created texts that they interacted with. The self-influence was then estimated as the difference between their previously stated opinion and the value of their written text, mapped onto a scale from 0 to 1.</p><p>In the second part of the intervention, participants were shown a text with a differing opinion.</p><p>We had prepared ten texts in advance, which were rated in a pre-study (n = 629).We then sorted each text to one of the ten steps of the opinion scale, so that we had a text illustrating each possible opinion. Each participant then was shown a text corresponding to the position that had the largest distance to the participant's own opinion while still lying within their confidence bound.</p><p>After they were presented with the text, participants were again asked to state their own opinion and opinion certainty. The study ended with a couple of questions as intervention checks ("Did you read the text you were shown?", "Did writing a short statement change your opinion?", "Did reading the other person's statement change your opinion?").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>To test hypothesis H1, we performed two regression analyses in which we predicted the confidence bound c and the self-influence m using the personality traits. Since both c and m were not normally distributed but bottom-heavy (in case of c) or top-heavy (in case of m), we decided to estimate a generalized mixed model (GLM) with gamma distribution and logistic link-function for each dependent variable. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> displays regression weights, p-values and which effect we hypothesized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows that only a subset of the theorized links between justice-relevant traits and the model parameters is supported in the expected direction.

That is, we had four model variations that qualitatively replicated the procedures of each original experiment. To compare the simulations to the original findings, we computed a study-specific statistic for each dataset (empirically informed model vs. a baseline model) and mapped it to a unit-interval score via monotone transforms. All four scores were computed separately for each source (empirically informed model vs. baseline); larger values indicate better qualitative agreement with the original finding.</p></div>

They had participants with strong prior attitudes evaluate mixed pro-and counter-attitudinal evidence; participants found congenial studies more convincing and became more polarized after exposure. To mimic simultaneous exposure to pro-and counter-attitudinal evidence, we inject two fixed evidence agents at the extremes (IDs 9,000,001 and 9,000,002) with x = -1 and x = +1 in the internal scale (mapped to <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref>), set to m = 1 and c = 0 (they never change and never listen). We connected them to all other agents. Other parameters remained at baseline (confirmation bias is neutral at w + = w -= 1). Operationally, each agent's neighborhood now always included both extreme sources if within c i ; the relative pull of the extremes depended on initial location and c i , reproducing the classic pattern that people weight congenial information more strongly and polarize relative to their priors when mixed evidence is present.</p></div>

We encode group membership once at t = 0 by the side of the midpoint: group i = 0 if x i (0) &lt; 5, else 1. We then (i) overweight ingroup opinions (g in = 1.3, g out = 1), and (ii) included a small extremizing drift around 5 (α = 0.08). Confirmation bias was neutral (w + = w -= 1), and selective exposure was off (κ = 0).

We implement two mechanisms from the experiment: (i) biased assimilation via asymmetric weights w + &gt; 1 for congenial content and w -≤ 1 (possibly &lt; 0 for counter-arguing) for uncongenial content; and (ii) selective exposure by sampling a similarity-biased subset of accepted neighbors with probabilities proportional to exp{κ(1 -d ij /c i )} (we used κ = 4 in the main runs; higher values increase homophily of exposure). All other parameters were set to their baseline value. In our code this means the neighbor set N i was first defined by bounded confidence, then thinned stochastically toward similar alters, and finally aggregated with congeniality-dependent weights, capturing the documented tendency to prefer agreeable information and to assimilate it more strongly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The fact that not all associations between traits and model parameters c and m were found as predicted in Study 1 leads to interesting theoretical implications. Our single-step design fixes exposure and strips away many situational affordances (relationship cues, platform features, strategic avoidance) that likely amplify trait effects on openness for differing opinions per se. Thus, the unexpected results are informative in that they indicate that empathy and indignation exert fast, gating-level shifts in c, whereas ambiguity tolerance and justice-sensitivity orientations may manifest more strongly when agents can select interlocutors, curate information, or interact repeatedly, which are the conditions that classic studies use. This helps refine theory by locating when and where trait to c pathways are most active, while confirming that trait to m pathways are already operative at the granularity of a single opinion-update.</p><p>Substantively, the moral-indignation result is especially interesting. Trait-like readiness to feel morally outraged is a relatively new addition to opinion-dynamics modeling, yet here it shows a clear, directional association with narrower c. This finding aligns with work on motivated reasoning and moralized discourse that links indignation to lower receptivity and greater polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lück &amp; Nardi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Nyhan &amp; Reifler, 2010)</ref>. In modeling terms, allowing indignation to shrink c generates more selective neighborhoods and, in turn, steeper effective confirmation dynamics-an empirically grounded pathway from moral emotion to macro-level opinion patterns.</p><p>The mixed success in reproducing patterns from four classic polarization findings in Study 2 also leads to several implications. They suggest that trait-based heterogeneity is helpful in reproducing certain polarization scenarios. Specifically backfire effects likely also depend on other variables such as message framing, identity threat, or networked exposure asymmetries that are not fully represented by c and m alone. Future models could experiment with adding these influences in addition or instead of our traits. More broadly, our results support calls to enrich ABMs with psychologically meaningful variables rather than relying solely on stylized heuristics (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sobkowicz, 2009)</ref>, and they highlight justice-focused constructs, particularly empathy and moral indignation, as promising levers for bridging micro-level measurement and macro-level dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our choice of traits is necessarily selective. A more global set (e.g., Big Five) or a more justice-centric set (e.g., belief in a just world, justice centrality) might explain additional variance in c and, especially, m. The current model also leaves some empirical patterns unexplained, likely because it omits mechanisms such as explicit social identity, group norms, dynamic homophily, framing effects, or asymmetrical processing of confirmatory vs. disconfirmatory evidence. As a next step we plan to introduce social groups and identity-weighted influence, and to test interaction terms (e.g., indignation and group salience). Finally, modeling is a perennial trade-off between realism and parsimony.</p><p>Naturally, the model could be made either more parsimonious or more realistic, but we deliberately aim for a pragmatic middle ground that preserves the parsimony of Hegselmann-Krause dynamics while adding real-world inter-agent heterogeneity by anchoring key parameters in justice related traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Classical averaging models become more informative when underpinned by domain knowledge from social science. Our findings identify where justice-related traits most reliably enter the opinion-updating pipeline: cognitive empathy and moral indignation act quickly on openness c, while broader trait influences on c likely unfold in settings that permit selective exposure and repeated contact; trait effects on m are already visible after one update. Empirically calibrated parameters thus move the model closer to observed polarization phenomena, even as they spotlight additional mechanisms needed to capture backfire. Taken together, this marks a step toward a pragmatic "sweet spot"-retaining the parsimony of Hegselmann-Krause dynamics while grounding key parameters in measurable social science constructs.

After visual inspection and posterior predictive checks, trait distributions were approximated either by a Normal or a zero-one-inflated Beta (ZOIB); Normal provided the better fit for all traits except ambiguity tolerance (Figure2). 1 Concretely, for each agent i with traits X i , we used the Gamma-log GLMs estimated on thesurvey data: log E[c | X] = -1.926 + 0.301 ce -0.465 a + 0.240 vjs -0.560 mi log E[m | X] = -0.198 + 0.044 vjs. We set c i = exp(•) as the agent-specific confidence radius (in the same units as opinions; see below), constrained to be nonnegative. Because m i serves as a weight in the convex combination below, we bounded it to [0, 1] (clipping values from the GLM if necessary) so that updates remained averages.</figDesc></figure>

We also ask whether this empirically tuned model better reproduces empirical polarization phenomena from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bail et al.
