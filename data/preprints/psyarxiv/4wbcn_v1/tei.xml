<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>INTRODUCTION: Modifiable behaviours such as smoking, diet, alcohol intake, sedentariness, and physical inactivity are associated with brain health, but longitudinal evidence in adults without dementia is limited. METHODS: Among 2214 UK Biobank participants with two MRI scans over 2.2 years, unweighted lifestyle scores (ranging 0 -10) were derived from five behaviours and classified as unfavourable, moderate, or favourable. Linear regression examined associations, and APOE e4 genotypic interactions, with changes in 16 brain volumetric markers.</p><p>RESULTS: Compared with favourable lifestyle, unfavourable lifestyle showed significantly greater grey matter (2059 mm³; 0.046 standard deviations [SDs]) and left hippocampal (36.5 mm³; 0.044 SD) atrophy. Moderate-risk drinking was linked to higher total brain atrophy (2075 mm³; 0.063 SD), while high-risk drinking and low physical activity associated with accelerated regional grey matter loss. No effects were found for smoking, diet, or sedentariness. High-risk drinking was associated with greater frontal lobe atrophy, particularly among APOE ε4 carriers. DISCUSSION: Lifestyle variables showed modest associations with brain atrophy, with alcohol drinking appearing most influential, with significant modification by APOE e4 genotype.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">BACKGROUND</head><p>With longer life expectancy, the prevalence of brain impairment and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing, such as dementia, which affected cognitive ability, memory, and the ability to perform daily activities in 57 million people worldwide in 2019. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Dementia is a global public health problem, and the number of people living with this disease is predicted to increase to 153 million by 2050. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Causes of dementia may include multiple diseases or injuries that directly and indirectly lead to brain damage and deterioration in cognitive function; Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the most common form, accounts for 60-70% of cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) e4 allele is known as the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Although effective and broadly indicated pharmacological treatments for dementia are still lacking, the Lancet Commission on dementia suggests that around 45% of dementia might be preventable by implementing interventions on modifiable risk factors, for example, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and physical inactivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Understanding the relationships between modifiable risk factors and brain structural changes is a priority to prevent or delay dementia.</p><p>Brain structure is a relatively sensitive mediator of cognitive health, and a more proximal phenotype to exposures, compared with cognitive test scores which are widely used to explore different abilities, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> but remains incompletely explored.</p><p>Associations between several modifiable risk factors and poorer brain health have been demonstrated through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotypes, for example, smoking and smaller grey matter volumes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> unhealthy diet and poorer brain connectivity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and habitual sedentary behaviour with poorer white matter health, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and excessive alcohol drinking with smaller grey matter volumes and poorer white matter tract integrity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Yet, it is difficult to infer potential causality because of limitations in these cross-sectional designs: these findings could reflect either differences in baseline levels, reverse causation, or long-term accumulated effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Longitudinal studies could isolate the change aspects and provide better tests of causality, which so far remain scarce. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Though human cognitive function changes continuously throughout life, preventive interventions in early-life might be effective for late-life brain health and cognitive outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> A few studies have provided longitudinal evidence on the associations between lifestyle and brain structural changes, such as, moderate and heavy alcohol drinking with greater decrease in cortical thickness of medial orbitofrontal cortex among 179 participants; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> null associations between the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet score and brain structural changes in UK Biobank. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> These studies were limited by small sample sizes or examining only a single lifestyle variable with brain structural changes, and neglected real-world clustering of risky lifestyle factors within individuals.</p><p>Convincing evidence that healthy lifestyle variables, either alone or in combination, can protect brain health and prevent dementia is lacking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Thus, large-scale cohorts with repeated neuroimaging data are warranted to elucidate the impacts of daily lifestyle variables on subtle but clinically meaningful brain structural changes over time while accounting for the genetic risk, and their interactions.</p><p>In the current study, we aim to examine whether and how individual/overall lifestyle(s), including smoking, alcohol drinking, diet, sedentary behaviour, and physical activity, influence atrophy in global brain measures as well as regional grey matter volumes in the frontal lobe, considering APOE e4 risk and its interactions among people living without dementia between two-timepoint scans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Study design and participants</head><p>Data for the current study were obtained from the UK Biobank, which is a large community-based cohort with 502,359 participants aged 37-73 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref>   <ref type="table">S1</ref>). We mainly focused on lifestyle variables and covariates collected at the time of first MRI scan as the baseline measures, and brain structural phenotypes in two scans. This research was completed using UK Biobank project number 17689.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Lifestyle</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Individual lifestyle variables</head><p>Participants self-reported their health related lifestyles at the first scan, including smoking status, alcohol intake, diet, sedentary behaviour duration and physical activity (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). The intercorrelations among lifestyle variables are shown in Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>.</p><p>Three levels (namely optimal, moderate, poor) for each lifestyle variable were defined based on public health guidelines. Smoking status was classified as never, former, and current smoker. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Alcohol drinking was defined here as low, moderate, and high risk, being defined by types, frequencies and units of weekly alcohol intake and grouped based on UK national guidelines: 0-14 units as low risk of disease; 15-35 units for females or 15-50 units for males as moderate risk; &gt; 35 units for females and &gt; 50 units for males as high risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Diet was categorized as healthy, moderate, and unhealthy based on a diet score for cardiovascular diseases sharing similar risk factors with dementia rather than the MIND diet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> because information on 24-hour diet recall being used to construct the MIND diet score were not collected when participants attended the first MRI scan. This current score was derived from the food frequency questionnaire, and constructed by the unweighted sum of adherence to the UK dietary guidelines, including: processed meat, red meat individually less than twice per week, total fish more than twice per week, consumption of semi-and skimmed, soya milk, no spread intake, more than five bowls of cereal intake, no salt added to food, more than six glasses of water and more than five servings per day of fruits and vegetables. There is currently no guideline for sedentary behaviour, only being recommended to limit the amount of time being sedentary by WHO; and using the WHO guidelines for physical activity of 150-300 minutes moderate or 75-150 minutes vigorous activity weekly would result in a highly left-skewed distribution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Tertiles were therefore used for categories of sedentary behaviour (time [in hours] spent driving, using a personal computer, and watching television), and physical activity (weekly metabolic equivalents task units [METs] minutes of walking, moderate and vigorous activity) as low, medium and high levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Unweighted lifestyle score and lifestyle categories</head><p>We assigned 0,1, and 2 points for each lifestyle variable based on the adherence to poor, moderate and optimal lifestyle behaviour, respectively. Two points were assigned for membership of each respective optimal level: never smoking; low risk drinking; healthy diet; low duration of sedentary behaviour; high level METs. One point was assigned for each of moderate-level lifestyles, such as former smoking, moderate risk drinking, moderate diet, medium duration sedentariness, and medium METs; and 0 for poor ones. An overall lifestyle score was summed across these five three-level lifestyle variables using an unweighted score, ranging from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating a healthier lifestyle. Based on the distribution of frequencies of participants' lifestyle scores (see Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>), participants who scored 0, 1, 2 or 3 were classed as unfavourable lifestyle; 4, 5, or 6 as moderate lifestyle; 7, 8, 9, or 10 as favourable lifestyle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> For example, someone who never smoked and had low risk drinking (two points each), moderate diet (one point), low sedentariness (two points) and high METs (two points) would receive nine points and be included in the favourable lifestyle group.</p><p>We used this method which prioritized clinical relevance and interpretability over statistical convenience, rather than tertiles which might mask meaningful biological patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Imaging data</head><p>Brain structural markers were measured using MRI performed with a 3 Tesla Siemens Skyra scanner (Siemens Healthineers) with VD13 software and a 32-channel head coil since 2014. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> In the current study, we used data from T1-weighted imaging, including global brain volumetric measures of grey matter, white matter, total brain; hippocampal volumes: left hippocampus, right hippocampus, hippocampal asymmetry (left minus right); volumetric measures of grey matter in frontal lobe (including frontal pole; superior frontal gyrus; middle frontal gyrus; inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis; inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis; frontal medial cortex; frontal orbital cortex; frontal operculum cortex, see Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>); these regions were selected as they have shown association with cognitive deficits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Additionally, we included the volume of white matter hyperintensities from the T2 FLAIR structural scan as this is strongly associated with dementia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> The primary outcomes of interest were grey matter volumes, white matter volumes, total brain volumes, white matter hyperintensities volumes, left/right hippocampal volumes, hippocampal asymmetry and volumes of grey matter in frontal lobe regions (all uncorrected for head size).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Genetic data</head><p>UK Biobank genotyping was conducted by Affymetrix using a bespoke BiLEVE Axiom array for ~50,000 participants and the remaining 450,000 on the Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom array. All genetic data were quality controlled by UK Biobank. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> The APOE e genotype is directly genotyped. The two APOE e single nucleotide polymorphisms-rs7412 and rs429358-were both in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p &gt; 0.05) assessed with PLINK V1.90. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Further information on the genotyping process is available (ukbiobank.ac.uk/scientists-3/geneticdata). For enough granularity to test lifestyle interactions, a dominant APOE e4 model -e3/e4 and e4/e4 collated vs. e2/e2, e2/e3 and e3/e3, was used as previous research showed that about 2% of the cohort were e4 homozygotes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> APOE e2/e4 was removed as standard practice because it has potentially both risk and protective alleles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Covariates</head><p>We used information from questionnaires completed at the first scan which recorded sociodemographic factors including age, sex (male or female), Townsend deprivation index (categorized as quintiles); 29 health factors on body mass index (BMI) as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> sleep durations as short (&lt;7 hours), normal (7-9 hours) or long (&gt;9 hours), <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> social isolation (yes or no), <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> history of diabetes (yes or no), hypertension (yes or no), and depression (yes or no). Genetic and imaging covariates were also included, such as genotypic arrays, the first 10 principal components for stratification, MRI sites (n=4), intracranial volume (ICV), which was generated by summing the volumes of white matter, grey matter, and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid at the first scan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and time intervals, which were the number of days between the dates of attending two scans. Since these measures were ascertained prior to brain imaging, they cannot be mediators and were treated as confounders (associated with both exposures and outcomes). We firstly examined the general associations of lifestyle categories (including unfavourable, moderate, and favourable lifestyles) and brain atrophy, additionally for continuous lifestyle scores. To further interpret the association, we computed adjusted marginal means of brain structural changes across lifestyle categories using margins in Stata, holding other covariates at their observed values. Then, the intuitive contributions of individual lifestyle variables on raw brain changes were investigated in two phases: 1) we estimated the associations of individual lifestyle variable with brain changes without adjusting for other lifestyle variables; 2) all lifestyle variables were included in one regression model simultaneously, being adjusted mutually in one multiple linear regression model for each brain MRI variable of interest. Interactions between APOE e4 status with lifestyle categories, and individual lifestyle variable, on brain structural atrophy were also tested.</p><p>Analyses were conducted in Stata v.18 and R (v4.2.3). We report two-sided Pvalues throughout and false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to keep the error rate at 0.05.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Characteristics of participants</head><p>A total of 2214 participants were included with complete information on lifestyle factors, APOE e4 genotype, and covariates in the first scan and brain structural markers of two scans (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The median (IQR) of follow up was 2.25 (0.30) years. The 2214 participants had a mean (SD) age of 61.3 (7.3) years in the first scan and 1099 (49.6%) were female (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). There were 547 (24.7%) participants carrying at least one copy of the e4 allele. Among e4 carriers, there were 250 (45.7%) participants with moderate lifestyles, followed by 249 (45.5%) with favourable lifestyles and 48 (8.8%) with unfavourable lifestyles. APOE e4 carriers were more likely to be younger (Cohen's d= 0.11, P=0.031) and have smaller white matter volume (Cohen's d= 0.10, P=0.036), and left hippocampal volume (Cohen's d= 0.12, P=0.018) in the first scan.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Lifestyle categories</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (with supporting information in Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>), compared with favourable lifestyle, unfavourable lifestyle was significantly associated with greater brain atrophy in grey matter and left hippocampal volumes, but not with other brain structural phenotypes. Participants with favourable lifestyle experienced a mean atrophy of 7883.8 mm 3 atrophy in grey matter and 63.6 mm 3 in left hippocampus independently, over a median follow-up of two years. Compared with the favourable lifestyle group, unfavourable lifestyle was associated with 2059.2 mm 3 more atrophy in grey matter, equivalent to 0.046 standard deviation (SD) greater decline (95% CI =-3966.5 to -152.0, P=0.034), and 36.5 mm 3 more atrophy in left hippocampus, equivalent to 0.044 SD greater decline (95% CI =-72.5 to -0.4, P=0.048). Additionally, a one-point increment in lifestyle score (out of 10 points) was associated with less grey matter loss (unstandardised β = 318.1, 95% CI =32.9 to 603.2, standardised β = 0.047, P=0.029), and less hippocampal asymmetry (unstandardised β = 6.4, 95% CI =0.2 to 12.6, standardised β = 0.044, P=0.042) in Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>. However, none of these associations remained significant after correction for multiple testing (p(FDR) &gt;0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Individual lifestyle variable</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> presents the heatmap of associations of individual and simultaneous lifestyle variables on longitudinal brain atrophy. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref> with supporting information in Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>, we observed significant impacts of single lifestyle variables on certain investigated brain markers. For example, for alcohol drinking, compared with low-risk drinking, high-risk drinking was associated with greater atrophy of 57.3 mm 3 in left hippocampal volume, corresponding to 0.062 SD greater loss (P=0.004), and accelerated decreased volumes of 48.9 mm 3 in inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis, corresponding to 0.048 SD greater loss (P=0.023), while moderate drinking was linked to accelerated total brain atrophy of 2075.4 mm 3 , corresponding to 0.063 SD greater loss (P=0.003), especially in grey matter volumes with 1336 mm 3 more atrophy, corresponding to 0.054 SD greater loss (P=0.012). For physical activity, compared with participants with high METs, those with low METs showed greater atrophy of 1255.4 mm3 in grey matter volumes, equvilent to 0.05 SD greater decrease (P=0.035), and those with medium METs attenuated white matter atrophy of 1413.7 mm 3 , equvilent to 0.05 SD greater decrease (P=0.035). These significant associations of each lifestyle variable on brain imaging markers remained largely consistent even when we included all lifestyle variables in one simultaneous regression model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref> with supporting information in Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>), although high-risk drinking's effect on left hippocampus reduced slightly from -0.062 SD to -0.055 SD. After FDR correction, only moderate drinking and total brain atrophy remained statistically significant (p(FDR) =0.045); all other associations became non-significant (p(FDR) &gt; 0.05). No significant associations were observed for smoking, diet or sedentary behaviour with brain structural atrophy in either univariable or multivariable models (all P&gt;0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Interaction of lifestyle and APOE e4 status on brain structural phenotypes</head><p>Two-way interaction tests of lifestyle categories × APOE e4 status for each brain imaging marker did not reveal significant interactions in Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>. However, in twoway interaction tests of each individual lifestyle variable × APOE e4 status on brain structural changes in Table <ref type="table">S10</ref>, significant interactions were found between high-risk drinking and APOE e4 status on regional grey matter atrophy in frontal lobe as well as moderate drinking and sedentary behaviour with regional brain changes. After correcting for multiple testing, only the interaction of high-risk drinking and APOE e4 status on regional grey matter atrophy in frontal lobe survived, including frontal pole, superior frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis, and frontal operculum cortex (p(FDR) &lt;0.05). Based on this finding, we then performed subgroup analyses stratified by APOE e4 status (Table <ref type="table">S11</ref>), which showed among e4 non-carriers, moderate drinking subtly accelerated atrophy in grey matter in frontal lobe regions except for frontal operculum cortex (standardised β ranges from -0.064 to -0.051, P&lt;0.05), but among e4 carriers, we observed greater decreased volumes (standardised β ranges from -0.093 to -0.072, P&lt;0.05) between high drinking and frontal lobe volumes. None of these associations remained significant when correcting for multiple testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In this longitudinal study, we showed that lifestyle and genetic risk for AD were associated with accelerated structural changes in a range of brain phenotypes over a period of up to 7 years. Longitudinal associations were nominally found between an overall unfavourable lifestyle, and grey matter and left hippocampal atrophy. Among individual lifestyle variables, alcohol drinking showed the most consistent effects on brain atrophy: moderate drinking was associated with total brain atrophy, as well as high drinking and declined volumes in the left hippocampus and frontal lobe at the follow-up scan. Moreover, we observed evidence of interaction between APOE e4 status and alcohol intake, with e4 carriers showing greater brain atrophy to the adverse effects of high-risk drinking. This is the first study to demonstrate that unfavourable lifestyles accelerate longitudinal grey matter and left hippocampus atrophy nominally, although associations were no longer significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.</p><p>However, for each lifestyle variable, they had impacts on certain brain volumetric changes.</p><p>Alcohol drinking was the most consistent lifestyle factor associated with brain atrophy in our study. Moderate drinking was associated with greater total brain atrophy after multiple testing, compared with low risk drinking. Our finding is also partly supported by a Mendelian randomization study reporting that moderate alcohol consumption was associated with higher brain iron, whose accumulation represented a potential mechanism for alcohol-related cognitive decline. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> High-risk drinking was associated with greater atrophy in left hippocampus and grey matter in inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis, generally in line with prior studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> This might be because of functional lateralization, which meant the left hippocampus was more involved in verbal memory processing and it was often negatively impacted by high alcohol consumption on cognitive function, making the impact on the left hippocampus more obvious. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> When including all lifestyle factors in one regression model, high-risk drinking was associated with less atrophy in left hippocampus based on the reduced beta. This might be because the detrimental effects of high alcohol consumption may be mitigated through other lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and avoiding smoking and long duration sedentariness. Evidence suggests that these healthy habits can enhance metabolic resilience, and reduce systemic inflammation, thereby counteracting alcohol-induced oxidative stress. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> We also observed that physical inactivity was associated with grey matter atrophy.</p><p>However, compared with high level METs, medium levels of physical activity were related to less white matter atrophy, namely, better brain ageing. This could be explained by moderate exercise leading to increased cerebral blood flow and neurotrophic factors, which may have a positive impact on angiogenesis and neurogenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> These effects translate to beneficial effects on structural brain measures associated with cognitive function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> High activity levels might be associated with metabolic strain, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> which could counteract the neuroprotective effects. We found that medium and high sedentariness were not associated with longitudinal brain atrophy. This is inconsistent with other studies which reported the relationship between sedentary behaviour and reduced white matter health. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> This might be due to overall time use patterns, as sedentary behaviour per se may not be detrimental when individuals compensate by engaging in sufficient physical activity during their nonsedentary time. We still cannot ignore the possibility that the multiple detrimental cardiovascular and metabolic effects led by sedentary behaviour can be intermediate risk factors for dementia, such as hypertension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> Other metabolic effects, including insulin resistance, and blood lipids, also have a negative impact on white matter health, which in turn might increase the risk of dementia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> Notably, although multiple significant cross-sectional associations between smoking, and diet and lower brain volumes have been reported, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> we found null associations between smoking or diet with longitudinal brain atrophy in the investigated brain structural markers. Of them, current or former smoking was not associated with brain changes in the current study. Our finding is inconsistent with previous research stating that smoking was associated with decreased structural integrity of multiple brain regions among elderly people without dementia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> This might be explained by the impacts of smoking on brain changes being distributed by other factors, or that the measurement of smoking is less precise than other, i.e. non-misclassification bias, and thus associations could not be detected. We cannot neglect the impact of chronic exposure of noxious agents in cigarette smoking, which may directly compromise neuronal and cellular membrane functions of cerebral tissue and lead to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> Furthermore, we found no significant associations of moderate or unhealthy diet with brain atrophy. We used a developed diet score from the food frequency questionnaire at the first scan designated for cardiovascular diseases which shared similar risk factors with cerebrovascular diseases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Although the MIND diet is well-known to slow cognitive decline and lower risks of all-cause dementia, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> data on 24-hour diet recall which is used to construct the MIND diet score was not collected at the first MRI scan in the UK Biobank, which meant we were unable to explore its impacts on brain changes properly. However, a prior study showed no significant associations between MIND diet and longitudinal brain structural changes by accessing the first wave of imaging data being taken long after dietary assessments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Significant interactions were found between high-risk drinking and APOE e4 status on grey matter volume decline in frontal lobe. Non-low risk drinking was significantly associated with decreased volumes of grey matter in frontal lobe regardless of APOE e4 status. However, APOE e4 carriers may be more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol-related neurodegeneration due to more brain atrophy compared with noncarriers. Our finding is supported by one study showing that heavy drinking history was associated with an earlier onset of AD by 2-3 years among APOE e4 carriers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> However, it contrasted with another study stating APOE e4 did not moderate the relationship between alcohol use and cognitive performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> This study was limited by a smaller sample size (N=818) and missing covariates of medical conditions. The findings remained unclear and further research on interaction tests are needed.</p><p>Major strengths were the relatively large sample size with long-term follow-up (up to 7 years), repeated brain MRI data for conducting longitudinal analyses, and simultaneous inclusion of multiple daily lifestyle factors that allowed us to investigate their individual and combined effects on brain changes. Moreover, the use of raw brain changes, adjusted for baseline brain phenotypes, yielded intuitive and robust results.</p><p>However, limitations remain. First, our findings might be underestimated potentially because of healthy volunteer bias. We have previously observed prevalent healthy bias in the imaging sub-sample from the already biased UK Biobank baseline sample. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref>  Fourth, despite excluding participants with at least one neurological condition in the current study, those with cognitive impairments were not specifically identified in this population-based sample. Thus, the results might be overestimated. Fifth, despite the longitudinal design, and the adjustment of a comprehensive list of confounders, residual confounding cannot be ruled out as with all other observational studies. Last but not least, potential reverse causality might exist; although we have shown evidence consistent with causal effects, we cannot conclude that the lifestyle factors themselves.</p><p>Our findings have several important implications. First, alcohol drinking consistently showed adverse effects, suggesting that this lifestyle variable may be a key modifiable target for preserving brain health. Notably, our findings identified associations of moderate intake with greater longitudinal brain atrophy: there has been a longstanding perception of moderate alcohol consumptionas safe, underscoring the need for cautious public health recommendations. Second, the significant interaction between APOE e4 status and alcohol use highlights the potential role of genetic susceptibility in modifying lifestyle effects on brain ageing. This supports the notion that prevention strategies should increasingly consider gene-environment interactions and be tailored to vulnerable subgroups such as APOE e4 carriers. Together, these implications emphasise the value of integrating lifestyle modification with personalised risk assessment in efforts to mitigate neurodegeneration and promote healthy brain ageing.</p><p>Our findings showed an overall unfavourable lifestyle was associated with greater longitudinal atrophy in grey matter and left hippocampus over time. Moderate and high-risk drinking accelerated brain atrophy, compared with low-risk drinking. Among APOE e4 carriers, high-risk drinking may be an important modifiable risk factor for brain atrophy, indicating a gene -lifestyle interaction in brain ageing. These findings advocate for public health strategies prioritizing relevant lifestyle interventions to delay cognitive aging and prevent dementia. processes, including the reasons for exclusion of participants FIGURE 2.

In 2014, MRI scanning of the heart, brain and abdomen for a subgroup of participants began; this is ongoing until the aim of 100,000 participants being scanned is reached. As of September 2023, 71,091 participants aged 44-85 years had attended the MRI assessment for the first time. Brain structural MRI data being processed at the first scan are available for 46,398 participants, and repeat imaging at the second scan for 4,784 participants. Participants who reported chronic neurological diseases before the first scan which could directly affect cognitive function were excluded (see Table</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>2. 6</head><label>6</label><figDesc>Statistical analysisCharacteristics of participants were described, stratified by the dominant APOE e4 model (presence versus absence), with Chi-square tests for categorical variables, ttests for normally distributed continuous variables, and Mann-Whitney U tests for not normally distributed continuous variables; MRI volumes were combined across hemispheres (summing left and right) for grey matter in the frontal lobe. For white matter hyperintensities, outlier values greater than 5 standard deviations (SDs) from the sample mean were excluded; data were log-transformed due to a positively skewed distribution. We used the raw change scores to examine the longitudinal associations between lifestyle, APOE e4 genotype, and brain atrophy by linear regression, where standardised betas, intuitive unstandardised betas and standard errors (SEs) were all reported. The outcome variables were defined as the differences of raw brain structural volumes (in mm 3 ) between follow-up and baseline scans (e.g. brain volumetric markers in the second scan minus markers in the first scan) and the main predictor was the lifestyle variable in each regression model. Each model was fully adjusted for corresponding brain structural values in the first scan; sociodemographic factors: age, sex, Townsend deprivation categories; genetic and imaging related factors: genotypic arrays, MRI sites, the first 10 principal components, ICV, and time intervals; health and social factors: BMI, sleep duration, isolated status, history of diabetes, hypertension, and depression. Positive betas indicate that the exposure group had less volume loss (i.e., attenuated atrophy) compared to the reference group, whereas negative betas indicate greater volume loss (i.e., accelerated atrophy), see Figure S2.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><figDesc>Second, lateralized effects of lifestyle factors on longitudinal brain ageing might exist as we investigated the summed left/right phenotypes in volumes of grey matter in the frontal lobe in analyses. For future studies, it might be interesting to examine the associations of specific lifestyle factors and left/right phenotype changes to explore potential underlying mechanisms. Third, while these associations highlight the neuroimaging consequences of specific lifestyle factors, the interplay between individual factors and white matter tracts remains underexplored. Future research should prioritize longitudinal investigations into how lifestyle factors influence white matter microstructural changes to elucidate their independent and synergistic effects.</figDesc></figure>
